"The *Blender Console Window* can display many different types of status "
"and error messages. Some messages simply inform the user what Blender is "
"doing, but have no real impact on Blender's ability to function. Other "
"messages can indicate serious errors that will most likely prevent "
"Blender carrying out a particular task and may even make Blender non-"
"responsive or shut down completely. The *Blender Console Window* messages"
" can also originate internally from within the Blender code or from "
"external sources such as :doc:`Python scripts "
"</editors/preferences/addons>`."
