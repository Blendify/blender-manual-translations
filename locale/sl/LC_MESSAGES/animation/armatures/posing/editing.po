"In *Pose Mode*, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions "

"The \"transform center\" of a given bone (i.e. its default pivot point, "

"some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact, except for "
"the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of "
"the selection (and not e.g. the active bone's root when *Active Object* "

"As previously noted, bones' transformations are performed based on the "
"*Rest Position* of the armature, which is its state as defined in *Edit "

"Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one "

" is especially important when using axis locking, for example, there is "
"no specific \"bone roll\" tool in *Pose Mode*, as you can rotate around "

"When you pose your armature, you are supposed to have one or more objects"

" skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very "
