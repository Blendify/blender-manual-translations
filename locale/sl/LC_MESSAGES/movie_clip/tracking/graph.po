"The graph or curves view has numerous purposes based on the color of the "
"lines. The red and green lines on the graph show you the speed of the "
"trackers at a given frame. Green is vertical movement, Red is horizontal."
" Therefore the first frames will always be at zero."

"The blue line is the line that comes out when you click on the film strip"
" is the average per-frame error. This curve is available only after "
"pressing camera solve and is not editable. This is the one line that you "
"want to be as flat as possible and as closer to zero as you can. The high"
" points will show you where in your shot you are having inaccurate "
"tracking."

msgid ""
"The curves are useful to see if particular trackers are moving "
"differently than the average. A line that spikes from the rest of the "
"curve usually means a tracking error."

msgid ""
"You can manually edit the curve by selecting a point in the curve and "
"dragging it or deleting, that will affect the corresponding tracker on "
"that particular frame."
