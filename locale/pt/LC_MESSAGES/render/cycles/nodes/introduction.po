"An important concept to understand when building node setups is that of "
"the **shader socket**. The output of all surface and volume shaders is a "
"shader, describing lighting interaction at the surface or of the volume, "
"rather than the color of the surface."

"Each shader node has a color input, and outputs a shader. These can then "
"be mixed and added together using Mix and Add Shader nodes. No other "
"operations are permitted. The resulting output can then be used by the "
"render engine to compute all light interactions, for direct lighting or "
"global illumination."

"Each texture type in Cycles corresponds to a node, with a texture "

"The default texture coordinates for all nodes are Generated coordinates, "
"with the exception of Image textures that use UV coordinates by default. "
"Each node includes some options to modify the texture mapping and "
