"Strength of the emitted light. For point and area lamps, the unit is "
"Watts. For materials, a value of 1.0 will ensure that the object in the "
"image has the exact same color as the Color input, i.e. make it "
"'shadeless'."

"Cycles uses a physically correct light falloff by default, whereas "
"Blender Internal uses a smoothed falloff with a Distance parameter. A "

"Smooth parameter."

"Lamp strength for point, spot and area lamps is specified in Watts. This "
"means you typically need higher values than Blender Internal, as you "
"couldn't use a 1W lamp to light a room; you need something stronger like "
"a 100W lamp."

"Sun lamps are specified in Watts/m^2, which require much smaller values "
"like 1 W/m^2. This can be confusing, but specifying strength in Watts "
"wouldn't have been convenient; the real sun for example has strength "
"384600000000000000000000000W. Emission shaders on meshes are also in "
"Watts/m^2."
