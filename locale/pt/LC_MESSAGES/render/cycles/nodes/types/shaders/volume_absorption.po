"The Volume Absorption Node allows light to be absorbed as is passes "
"through it. Typical usage for this node would be water and glass. It can "
"also be used with the :doc:`Volume Scatter "
"</render/cycles/nodes/types/shaders/volume_scatter>` node to create "
"smoke. This node must be plugged into the :ref:`Volume Output "
"<cycles_shader_output_material>`."
