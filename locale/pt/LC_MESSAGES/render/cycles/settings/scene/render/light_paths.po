"The maximum number of light bounces can be controlled manually. While "

"Light paths are terminated probabilistically when specifying a minimum "
"number of light bounces lower than the maximum. In that case paths longer"

"The transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "

"Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF. Other "
