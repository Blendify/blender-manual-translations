"The baking happens into the respective active textures of the object "
"materials. The active texture is the last selected Image Texture node of "
"the material nodetree. That means the active object (or the selected "
"objects, when not baking 'Selected to Active') needs a material, and that"
" material needs at least an Image Texture node, with the image to be used"
" for the baking. Note, the node doesn't need to be connected to any other"
" node. The active texture is what projection painting and the viewport "
"use as a criteria to which image to use. This way after the baking is "
"done you can automatically preview the baked result in the Texture mode."
