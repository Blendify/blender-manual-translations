"In many real life situations, like skin or metals, the color of diffuse "
"and specular reflections can differ slightly, based on the amount of "
"energy a surface receives or on the light angle of incidence. The *Ramp "
"Shader* options in Blender allow you to set a range of colors for a "
"*Material*, and define how the range will vary over a surface, and how it"
" blends with the 'actual color' (typically from a material or as output "
"of a texture)."

"Ramps allow you to precisely control the color gradient across a "
"material, rather than just a simple blend from a brightened color to a "
"darkened color, from the most strongly lit area to the darkest lit area. "
"As well as several options for controlling the gradient from lit to "
"shadowed, ramps also provide 'normal' input, to define a gradient from "
"surfaces facing the camera to surfaces facing away from the camera. This "
"is often used for materials like some types of metallic car paint that "
"change color based on viewing angle."

"Since texture calculations in Blender happen before shading, the *Ramp "
"Shader* can completely replace texture or material color. But by use of "
"the mixing options and Alpha values it is possible to create an "
"additional layer of shading in Blender materials."

"While all three previous options work per lamp, this option only works "
