#~ msgid ""
#~ "When loading and saving media formats"
#~ " it is important to color management"
#~ " in mind. File formats such as "
#~ "PNG or JPEG will typically store "
#~ "colors in a color space ready for"
#~ " display, not in a linear space. "
#~ "When they are, for example, used "
#~ "as textures in renders, they need "
#~ "to be converted to linear first, "
#~ "and when saving renders for display "
#~ "on the web, they also need to "
#~ "be converted to a display space. "
#~ "Other file formats like OpenEXR store"
#~ " linear color spaces and as such "
#~ "are useful as intermediate files in "
#~ "production."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When working with image files, the "
#~ "default color space is usually the "
#~ "right one. If this is not the "
#~ "case, the color space of the image"
#~ " file can be configured in the "
#~ "image settings. A common situation where"
#~ " manual changes are needed is when"
#~ " working with or baking normal maps"
#~ " or displacement maps, for example. "
#~ "Such maps do not actually store "
#~ "colors, just data encoded as colors. "
#~ "In such cases they should be "
#~ "marked as *Non-Color Data*."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Image data-blocks will always store "
#~ "float buffers in memory in the "
#~ "scene linear color space, while a "
#~ "byte buffer in memory and files on"
#~ " disk are stored in the color "
#~ "space specified with this setting:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Color Space"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The color space of the image on"
#~ " disk. This depends on the file "
#~ "format, for example PNG or JPEG "
#~ "images are often stored in sRGB, "
#~ "while OpenEXR images are stored in "
#~ "a linear color space. Some images "
#~ "such as normal, bump or stencil "
#~ "maps do not strictly contain 'colors',"
#~ " and on such values no color "
#~ "space conversion should ever be applied."
#~ " For such images the color space "
#~ "should be set to None."

#~ "By default only renders are displayed"
#~ " and saved with the render view "
#~ "transformations applied. These are the "
#~ "Render Result and Viewer image data-"
#~ "blocks, and the files saved directly "
#~ "to disk with the Render Animation "
#~ "operator. However, when loading a render"
#~ " saved to an intermediate OpenEXR "
#~ "file, Blender cannot detect automatically "
#~ "that this is a render (it could"
#~ " be e.g. an image texture or "
#~ "displacement map). We need to specify"
#~ " that this is a render and that"
#~ " we want the transformations applied, "
#~ "with these two settings:"

#~ msgid "View as Render"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Display the image data-block (not "
#~ "only renders) with view transform, "
#~ "exposure, gamma, RGB curves applied. "
#~ "Useful for viewing rendered frames in"
#~ " linear OpenEXR files the same as "
#~ "when rendering them directly."

#~ msgid "Save as Render"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Option in the image save operator "
#~ "to apply the view transform, exposure,"

#~ " PNG or JPEG files in display "
#~ "space."

#~ msgid "OpenColorIO Configuration"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Blender comes with a standard "
#~ "OpenColorIO configuration that contains a "
#~ "number of useful display devices and "
#~ "view transforms. The reference linear "
#~ "color space used is the linear "
#~ "color space with Rec. 709 chromaticities"
#~ " and D65 white point."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "However, OpenColorIO was also designed "
#~ "to give a consistent user experience "
#~ "across `multiple applications "
#~ "<http://opencolorio.org/CompatibleSoftware.html>`__, and "
#~ "for this a single shared configuration"
#~ " file can be used. Blender will "
#~ "use the standard OCIO environment "
#~ "variable to read an OpenColorIO "
#~ "configuration other than the default "
#~ "Blender one. More information about how"
#~ " to set up such a workflow can"
#~ " be found on the `OpenColorIO website"
#~ " <http://opencolorio.org/>`__."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "We currently use the following color space roles:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "scene_linear"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "color space used for rendering, "
#~ "compositing, and storing all float "
#~ "precision images in memory."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "default_sequencer"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "default color space for sequencer, *scene_linear* if not specified"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "default_byte"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "default color space for byte precision"
#~ " images and files, *texture_paint* if "

#~ msgid "default_float"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "default color space for float precision"
#~ " images and files, *scene_linear* if "

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The standard Blender configuration also "
#~ "includes some support for `ACES "
#~ "<https://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-"
#~ "projects/aces>`__ (`code and documentation "
#~ "<https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev>`__), even though"
#~ " we have a different linear color "
#~ "space. It is possible to load and"
#~ " save EXR files with the Linear "
#~ "ACES color space, and the RRT view"
#~ " transform can be used to view "
#~ "images with their standard display "
#~ "transform. However, the ACES gamut is"
#~ " larger than the Rec. 709 gamut, "
#~ "so for best results an ACES "
#~ "specific configuration file should be "
#~ "used. OpenColorIO provides an `ACES "
#~ "configuration "
#~ "<http://opencolorio.org/configurations/index.html>`__, though"
#~ " it may need a few more tweaks"
#~ " to be usable in production."
