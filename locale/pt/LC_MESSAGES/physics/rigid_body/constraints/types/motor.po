"The motor constraint causes translation and/or rotation between two "
"entities. It can drive two objects apart or together. It can drive simple"
" rotation, or rotation and translation (although it will not be "
"constrained like a screw since the translation can be blocked by other "
"physics without preventing rotation)."

"The rotation axis is the X axis of the object hosting the constraint. "
"This is in contrast with the Hinge which uses the Z axis. Since the Motor"
" is vulnerable to confusing perturbations without a matching Hinge "
"constraint, special care must be taken to align the axes. Without proper "
"alignment, the motor will appear to have no effect (because the hinge is "
"preventing the motion of the motor)."
