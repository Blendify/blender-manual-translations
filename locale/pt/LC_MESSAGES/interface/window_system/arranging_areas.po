msgid ""
"Blender uses a novel screen-splitting approach to arrange areas. The "
"application window is always a rectangle on your desktop. It divides it "
"up into a number of re-sizable areas. An area contains the workspace for "
"a particular type of window, like a 3D View window, or an Outliner. The "
"idea is that you split up that big application window into any number of "
"smaller (but still rectangular) non-overlapping area. That way, each "
"window is always fully visible, and it is very easy to work in one window"
" and hop over to work in another."

msgid ""
"You can maximize an area to fill the whole application window with "
":menuselection:`View --> Toggle Full Screen` menu entry. To return to "
"normal size, use again :menuselection:`View --> Toggle Full Screen`. A "
"quicker way to achieve this is to use :kbd:`Shift-Spacebar`, :kbd:`Ctrl-"
"Down` or :kbd:`Ctrl-Up` to toggle between maximized and areas."

"In the upper right and lower left corners of a window are the window "
"splitter widgets, and they look like a little ridged thumb grip. It both "
"splits and combines window panes. When you hover over it, your cursor "
"will change to a cross. :kbd:`LMB` and drag it to the left to split the "
"window pane vertically, or downward to split it horizontally."

msgid ""
"In order to merge two areas, they must be the same dimension in the "
"direction you wish to merge. For example, if you want to combine two "
"areas that are side-by-side, they must be the same height. If the one on "
"the left is not the same as the one on the right, you will not be able to"
" combine them horizontally. This is so that the combined window space "
"results in a rectangle. The same rule holds for joining two areas that "
"are stacked on top of one another; they must both have the same width. If"
" the one above is split vertically, you must first merge those two, and "
"then join the bottom one up to the upper one."

msgid ""
"To merge the current window with the one above it (in the picture the "
"properties window is being merged \"over\" the Outliner), hover the mouse"
" pointer over the window splitter. When the pointer changes to a cross, "
":kbd:`LMB` click and drag up to begin the process of combining. The upper"
" window will get a little darker, overlaid with an arrow pointing up. "
"This indicates that the lower (current) area will \"take over\" that "
"darkened area space. Let go of the :kbd:`LMB` to merge. If you want the "
"reverse to occur, move your mouse cursor back into the original (lower) "
"area, and it will instead get the arrow overlay."

"You can swap the contents between two areas with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` on one "

"and releasing the mouse there. The two areas don't need to be side by "

"You can also create a new window from an existing area by :kbd:`Shift-"
"LMB` on a area splitter, and dragging slightly. A new window pops up, "

"window on which you performed the operation."

"you can also arrange its contents in the same way discussed so far (split"
" and resize areas, and tune them as needed), and so on."
