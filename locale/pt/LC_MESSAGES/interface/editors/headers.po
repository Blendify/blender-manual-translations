"All editors have a header (the strip with a lighter gray background "
"containing icon buttons). The header may be at the top (as with the "
"*Properties Window*) or the bottom (as with the 3D View) of a window's "
"area. The picture below shows the header of the 3D View:"

"If you move the mouse over a window, its header changes to a slightly "
"lighter shade of gray. This means that it is \"focused\". All hotkeys you"
" press will now affect the contents of this window."

msgid ""
"To hide a header, move your mouse over the thin line between a window and"
" its header, until the pointer takes the form of an up/down arrow. Then "
"click, hold and drag with :kbd:`LMB` from the window over the header to "
"hide the latter."

msgid ""
"In the 3D View, there are up to two more of these little plus signs (to "
"the top left and right of the window). Those will open panels with "
"several tools, not a second header."

"To move a header from top to bottom or the other way round, simply "
":kbd:`RMB` on it and select the appropriate item from the pop-up menu. If"
" the header is at the top, the item text will read \"Flip to Bottom\", "

msgid ""
"Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to "
"suit the needs of the user. If you find that the colors you see on screen"
" do not match those mentioned in the Manual then it could be that your "
"default theme has been altered. Creating a new theme or "
"selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting the "
":doc:`User Preferences </preferences/index>` window and clicking on the "
"*Themes* tab of the window."

"Most Window Headers, located immediately next to this first \"Window "
"Type\" Menu button, exhibit a set of menus which can be hidden - again "
"with a little minus sign. So if you cannot find a menu that was mentioned"
" somewhere, try looking for a little plus sign (once again) next to the "
"\"Window Type\" button. By clicking :kbd:`LMB` on it, the menu will come "
"back."
