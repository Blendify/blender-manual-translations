"Use the texture data-block at the bottom of the paint panel to select a "
"pre-loaded image or procedural texture to use as your brush pattern. Note"
" that in order to use it, you must have a placeholder material defined, "
"and that particular texture defined using the Material and Texture "
"buttons. It is not necessary to have that material or texture applied to "
"any mesh anywhere; it must only be defined."
