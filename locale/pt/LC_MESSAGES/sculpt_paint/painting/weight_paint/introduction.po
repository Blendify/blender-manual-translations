msgid "Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned vertex). *Weight Painting* is a method to maintain large amounts of weight information in a very intuitive way. It is primarily used for rigging meshes, where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone influences on the mesh. But we use it also for controlling particle emission, hair density, many modifiers, shape keys, etc."
msgstr "Os grupos de vértices podem ter potencialmente um grande número de vértices associados e portanto um grande número de pesos de influência (pois há um valor de peso de influência para cada um dos vértices atribuídos). A *Pintura de influência* é um método para manter grandes quantidades de informações de pesos de influência de uma maneira bastante intuitiva. Ela é usada inicialmente para os arranjos de animação de malhas, onde os grupos de vértices são usados para definir as influẽncias relativas dos ossos sobre a malhal. Mas nós também a utilizamos para o controle de emissão de partículas, a densidade dos cabelos, e para muitos outros modificadores, chaves de formato, etc."

msgid "The basic principle of the method is: the weight information is literally *painted* on top of the Mesh body by using a set of Weight brushes. And since painting is always associated with color, we also need to define ..."
msgstr "O princípio básico do método é: A informação dos pesos é literalmente *pintada* sobre o corpo da malha usando um conjunto de pinceis de pesos de influência. E devido ao fato da influência ser sempre associada a determinadas cores, nós também definimos as influências pela conversão da pintura em valores."

msgid "This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, vertices around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to mimic the stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight (10 - 40%) paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a little when the bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically assign weights to an armature (see the :doc:`Armature section </rigging/index>`), you can do this manually. To do this from scratch, refer to the process below. To modify automatically assigned weights, jump into the middle of the process where noted:"
