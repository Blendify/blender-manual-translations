"Blender offers both `Bézier Curves`_ and `Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines "

"Both Bézier and NURBs curves are named after their mathematical "
"definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they"
" are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's "
"perspective. Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they "
"start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBs curves are "
"more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists "
"and turns in a curve."

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
"curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less "
"memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural "

"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a "
