"Unlike meshes or curves, you cannot generally directly add new control "
"points to a surface (with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` clicks), as you can only extend"
" a surface by adding a whole U or V row at once. The only exception is "
"when working on a NURBS surface curve, i.e. a surface with only one "
"control point on each U or V row. In this special case, all works exactly"
" as with :ref:`curves <modeling-curves-extrude>`."

"As for curves, you cannot create a new surface in your object out of "
"nowhere, by just :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` -- clicking with nothing selected. "
"However, unlike for curves, there is no \"cut\" option allowing you to "
"separate a surface into several parts, so you only can create a new "
"surface by :ref:`Duplicating <modeling_surface_editing_duplicating>` an "
"existing one, or adding a new one with the *Add* menu."
