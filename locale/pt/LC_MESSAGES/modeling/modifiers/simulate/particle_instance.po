"When a *Particle Instance* modifier is added to an object, that object "

"*Particle Instance* modifier will appear to do nothing."

"Because of the co-dependant way in which the *Particle Instance* modifier"
" is influenced by the underlying particle systems on other objects, some "
"of the apparent effects generated by the *Particle Instance* modifier can"
" look and act vastly different, depending on the underlying settings of "
"the particle systems it is associated with. This is worth taking account "
"of if the *Particle Instance* modifier settings do not appear to be "
"giving the results expected, as it may indicate that the particle system "
"settings may need altering rather than the *Particle Instance* modifier "

"modifier's mesh. If for example a sphere has a *Particle Instance* "
"modifier added to it, when the *Object* field of this modifier is filled "
"in with the name of an object that emits particles, those particle will "
"be sphere shaped. Even though most of the time the *Object* field will "
