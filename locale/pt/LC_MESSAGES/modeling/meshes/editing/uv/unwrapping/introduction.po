"The first step is to unwrap your mesh. You want to unwrap when you feel "
"your mesh is complete with respect to the number of faces it needs to "
"have. If you do add faces or subdivide existing faces when a model is "
"already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces for you, but you may "
"need to do additional mapping or editing. In this fashion, you can use "
"the UV texture image to guide additional geometry changes."
msgstr ""
"O primeiro passo é desdobrar a sua malha (em alguns locais, o termo "
"\"desempacotar\" também é usado). Você irá desdobrar a sua malha quando "
"perceber que sua malha está completa em relação ao número de faces que "
"ela deve ter. Caso você adicione faces ou subdivida as faces existentes "
"quando um modelo já tiver sido desdobrado, o Blender irá adicionar estas "
"novas faces para você, mas você poderá precisar realizar novos "
"mapeamentos adicionais ou edições. Desta maneira, você poderá usar a "
"textura de imagem UV para guiar alterações de geometria adicional."

"Each face of a mesh can have many UV textures. Each UV texture can have "
"an individual image assigned to it. When you unwrap a face to a UV "
"texture in the UV Editor, each face of the mesh is automatically assigned"
" *four UV coordinates:* These coordinates define the way an image or a "
"texture is mapped onto the face. These are 2D coordinates, which is why "
"they are called UV, to distinguish them from XYZ coordinates. These "
"coordinates can be used for rendering or for real-time viewport display "
"as well."

"\"Face Select\" mode to be able to assign Images or change UV coordinates"
" of the active Mesh Object. This allows a face to participate in many UV "
