"This effect works by itself to create a color strip. By default, when it "
"is created, it is 50 frames long, but you can extend it by grabbing and "
"moving one of the ends. Click on the color button in the Effect panel "
"under Sequencer buttons, which is under the Scene tab, to pick a "
"different color (by default, it is gray). Use this strip crossed with "
"your main movie to provide a fade-in or fade-out."
