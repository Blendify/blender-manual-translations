"Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when "
"each drawing, sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They "
"nicknamed this the \"dope sheet\". While CG foundations dramatically "
"differ from classical hand-drawn animation, Blender's *Dope Sheet* "
"inherits a similar directive. It gives the animator a \"birds-eye-view\" "
"of every thing occurring within a scene."
