"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video."
" There are two possible methods for this one being the :doc:`Compositor "
"</compositing/introduction>`. However, this chapter is on the other, the "
"Video Sequence Editor (VSE) and some time shorten to just Sequencer. The "
"Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows "
"you to combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can "
"use these effects to create powerful video edits (especially when you "
"combine it with the animation power of Blender!)."

"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or"
" in some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link "
"the end of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can audio "
"and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."

"The View Types toggles in the header allow you to change the view of the "
"VSE. When the first button is toggled only the Sequencer is displayed "
