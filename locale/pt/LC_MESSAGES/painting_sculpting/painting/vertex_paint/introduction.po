"Vertex Painting is a simple way of painting color onto an object, by "
"directly manipulating the color of vertices, rather than textures, and is"
" fairly straightforward."

msgid ""
"When a vertex is painted, the color of the vertex is modified according "
"to the rules of the 'brush'. The color of all visible planes and edges "
"attached to the vertex are then modified with a gradient to the color of "
"the other connected vertices. (Note that the color of non-visible faces "
"are not modified)."
