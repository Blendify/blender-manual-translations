"This node scales the size of an image. Scaling can be either absolute or "
"relative. If Absolute toggle is on, you can define the size of an image "

"For instance X: 0.5 and Y: 0.5 would produce an image which width and "

"greatly, you might want to blur it somewhat to remove the square corners "
"that might result."

"Use this node to match image sizes. Most nodes produce an image that is "
"the same size as the image input into their top image socket. So, if you "
"want to uniformly combine two images of different size, you must scale "
"the second to match the resolution of the first."
