msgid ""
"The Frame node is a useful tool for organizing nodes by collecting "
"related nodes together in a common area. Frames are useful when a node "
"setup becomes large and confusing yet the re-usability of a Node Group is"
" not required."

msgid "Adding and Removing Nodes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:16
msgid ""
"Once a Frame node is placed in the editor, nodes can be added by simply "
"dropping them onto the frame or by selecting the node(s) then the frame "
"and using :kbd:`Ctrl-P`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:19
msgid ""
"To remove them select the node(s) and use the :kbd:`Alt-P` shortcut. This"
" uses the same default keyboard bindings as Parenting and can be thought "
"of as a similar concept."

msgid "Resizing Frame"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:26
msgid ""
"When the Frame node is first placed in the node editor workspace it may "
"be resized by dragging one of the edges."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:28
msgid ""
"Once a node is placed in the Frame, the Frame shrinks around it so as to "
"remove wasted space. At this point it is no longer possible to grab the "
"edge of the Frame to resize it, instead resizing occurs automatically "
"when nodes within the Frame are rearranged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:32
msgid ""
"This behavior can be changed by disabling the *Shrink* option in the "
"Properties tab of the Properties region (:kbd:`N`)."

msgid "Label and Color"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:39
msgid ""
"Frame Nodes can be given a title by modifying the Label field in the "
"properties panel. Label size can be changed as well so that, for example,"
" subordinate Frames have smaller titles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:42
msgid ""
"Frame Node colors can be applied from the properties panel which can be "
"used to provide a powerful visual cue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a satisfactory color is found it may be saved as a preset for re-use"
" in other Frame nodes. To do this press the *+* button next to the Color "
"Presets drop down in the properties panel and add a name for the preset. "
"To delete a preset first choose that preset for the active Frame and "
"press the *-* button in the properties panel."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:53
msgid ""
"When you need to display more comprehensive text, frame nodes can display"
" the contents of a text-block."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/layout/frame.rst:55
msgid ""
"This is read-only, so you'll need to use the text editor to modify the "
"contents."
