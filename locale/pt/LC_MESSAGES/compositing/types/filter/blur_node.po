"The Blur node blurs an image, using one of seven blur modes (set using "
"the upper-left pop-up button), and a radius defined by the X and Y number"
" buttons. By default, these are set to zero, so to enable the node you "
"must set one or both to a value greater than 0. You can optionally "
"connect a value image to the Size input node, to control the blur radius "
"with a mask. The values must be mapped between 0-1 for best effect, as "
"they will be multiplied with the X and Y number button values."

"The Bokeh button (only visible as Bok or Bo on some screen setups) will "
"force the blur node to use a circular blur filter. This gives higher "
"quality results, but is slower than using a normal filter. The Gam button"
" (for \"gamma\") makes the Blur node gamma-correct the image before "
"blurring it."

"An example blend-file, in fact, the one used to create the image above, "
"`is available here. <https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Media:Manual-"
"Node-Blur.blend>`__ The blend-file takes one image from the RenderLayer "
"\"Blurs\" and blurs it while offsetting it (Translate) and then combining"
" it (AlphaOver) to build up the progressive sequence of blurs. Play with "
"the Value and Multiply nodes to change the amount of blurring that each "
"algorithm does."
