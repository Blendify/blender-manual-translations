"A powerful but often overlooked feature of the ColorRamp is to create an "
"Alpha Mask, or a mask that is overlaid on top of another image, and, like"
" a mask, allows some of the background to show through. The example map "
"below shows how to use the Color Ramp node to do this:"

"In the map above, a black and white swirl image, which is lacking an "
"alpha channel, is fed into the ColorRamp node as a *Fac* tor. "
"(Technically, we should have converted the image to a value using the "
"RGB-to-BW node, buy hey, this works just as well since we are using a BW "
"image as input.)"

"We have set the ColorRamp node to a purely transparent color on the left "
"end of the spectrum, and a fully Red color on the right. As seen in the "
"viewer, the ColorRamp node puts out a mask that is fully transparent "
"where the image is black. Black is zero, so ColorRamp uses the color at "
"the left end of the spectrum, which we have set to transparent. The "
"ColorRamp image is fully red and opaque where the image is white (1.00)."

"We verify that the output image mask is indeed transparent by overlaying "
"it on top of a pumpkin image. For fun, we made that AlphaOver output "
"image 0.66 transparent so that we can, in the future, overlay the image "
"on a flashing white background to simulate a scary scene with lighting "
"flashes."

"The real power of ColorRamp is that multiple colors can be added to the "

"In this example, we have mapped the shades of gray in the input image to "
"three colors, blue, yellow, and red, all fully opaque (Alpha of 1.00). "
"Where the image is black, ColorRamp substitutes blue, the currently "
"selected color. Where it is some shade of gray, ColorRamp chooses a "
"corresponding color from the spectrum (bluish, yellow, to reddish). Where"
" the image is fully white, ColorRamp chooses red."
