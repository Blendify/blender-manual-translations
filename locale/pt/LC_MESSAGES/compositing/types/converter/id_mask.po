"This node will use the Object Index pass (see RenderLayers) to produce an"
" anti-aliased alpha mask for the object index specified. The mask is "
"opaque where the object is, and transparent where the object is not. If "
"the object is partially transparent, the alpha mask matches the object's "
"transparency. This post-process function fills in the jaggies with "
"interpolated values."

"You can specify, for any of the objects in your scene, an Object Index as"
" shown the right (the currently select object has an index of 2). When "
"rendered, if Object Index passes are enabled, its index will be 2, and "
"setting the ID Mask node to 2 will show where that object is in the "
"scene."

"In this example, the left rear red cube is assigned PassIndex 1, and the "
"right cube PassIndex 2. Where the two cubes intersect, there is going to "
"be noticeable pixelation because they come together at a sharp angle and "
"are different colors. Using the mask from object 1, which is smoothed "
"(antialiased) at the edges, we use a *Mix Node* set on *Multiply* to "
"multiply the smoothed edges of the image, thus removing those nasty "
"lines, thus, being smoothed out."

"Note that the mask returns white where the object is fully visible to the"
" camera (not behind anything else) and black for the part of the object "
"that is partially or totally obscured by a fully or partially opaque "
"object in front of it. If something else is in front of it, even if that "
"thing is partially transparent and you can see the object in a render, "
"the mask will not reflect that partially obscured part."
