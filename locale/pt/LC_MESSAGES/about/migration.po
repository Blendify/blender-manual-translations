"At the end of 2014, we migrated the manual from MediaWiki to Sphinx, "
"which uses the reStructuredText markup language."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:8
msgid ""
"This is a somewhat controversial decision, so this sections explains some"
" of the reasons why we felt Sphinx was worth moving to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:11
msgid ""
"We realize that a change in technology alone will not solve all problems,"
" at the end of the day, it is really up to us to write a better manual, "
"but there were some issues with ``wiki.blender.org`` which made it "
"difficult to work with."

msgid ""
"Note that these are subjective points, more could be written on this. "
"However for the purpose of maintaining a manual, here are some pros and "
"cons for each system."

msgid "Cons"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:44
msgid "Poor version handling"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:44
msgid ""
"With a wiki, we cannot easily document new features during the "
"development process. The current wiki may include information which is "
"valid for a nightly build, but not the latest stable release."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:48
msgid "Low quality *drive-by* edits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:47
msgid ""
"many pages would have incomplete edits, incorrect information or too much"
" highly detailed text written on a topic. So while ease of contribution "
"has its benefits, it proved to be problematic too."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:51
msgid "Poor Peer Review"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:51
msgid ""
"It was hard to properly peer review edits, a lot of changes would be made"
" with no feedback. Writers did not really know if their work was "
"considered good quality or not."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:54
msgid "Page Hierarchy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:54
msgid ""
"The hierarchy in Blender's wiki was supported with an extension to "
"MediaWiki, but it is something that MediaWiki does not support, managing "
"this tree online is cumbersome."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:59
msgid "No Project Management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:57
msgid ""

msgid "Local Structure"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:72
msgid ""
"More easily manage the overall structure of the manual, move pages and "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:78
msgid "Automated Edits"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:75
msgid ""
"Local files means we can more easily manipulate text, using text editors "
"of choice, search/replace words and generally edit the manual without "
"having to load up a webpage first. (``wiki.blender.org`` access is slow "
"in some countries)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:79
msgid ""
"Tasks such as running a spell-checker, on the entire manual, was not "

msgid "Project Management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:81
msgid ""
"While this is not directly a feature of Sphinx, using version-control "
"means we can integrate a `project management system "
"<https://developer.blender.org/project/profile/53>`__ (Phabricator in "
"this case)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:85
msgid ""
"This means we can have a central place to track issues, set goals for "
"releases and assign tasks."

msgid "No online editing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:92

msgid "Barrier of Entry"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:103
msgid ""
"Increasing the barrier of entry is not something to be taken lightly, "
"however, it is our opinion that the trade-off is worthwhile."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:106
msgid ""
"The short term benefit of quick & easy editing with the Wiki, has to be "
"weighed against the long-term benefits of using a system better suited to"
" collaboratively writing a document."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:110
msgid ""
"We have observed the quality of drive-by edits varies a lot, sometimes "
"adding redundant text and even misinformation at times."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:113
msgid ""
"Often, low-quality content would stay un-edited or incomplete, instead of"
" being improved by others or removed."

msgid "Conclusion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:120
msgid ""
"Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, it is yet to be seen if"
" we can effectively maintain a manual with the new system that has been "
"proposed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/about/migration.rst:123
msgid ""
"But ``wiki.blender.org`` had some years to create the manual and while "
"some areas were very high quality, it remained a mix of old docs and poor"
" quality content for the most part."
