"In the BGE, an object can have different \"states\". At any time while "
"the game is playing, the current state of the object defines its "
"behavior. For instance, a character in your game may have states "
"representing awake, sleeping or dead. At any moment their behavior in "
"response to a loud bang will be dependent on their current state; they "
"may crouch down (awake); wake up (asleep) or do nothing (dead)."

"States are set up and used through controllers: note that only "
"controllers, not actuators and sensors, are directly controlled by the "
"state system. Each object has a number of states (up to 30; default = 1),"
" and can only be in one state at any particular time. A controller must "
"always specify the state for which it will operate - it will only give an"
" output pulse if a) its logic conditions are met, and b) the object is "
"currently in the specified State. States are set up and edited in the "
"object's Controller settings (for details see below)."

msgid ""
"State settings are automatic in simple games. By default, the number of "
"states for each object is 1, and all controllers are set to use State 1. "
"So, if a game does not need multiple states, everything will work without"
" explicitly setting states - you do not need to bother about states at "
"all."

msgid ""
"One of the actuators, the State actuator, can set or unset the object's "
"State bits, and so allow the object's reaction to a sensor signal to "
"depend on its current state. So, in the above example, the actor will "
"have a number of controllers connected to the \"loud bang\" sensor, for "
"each of the \"awake\", \"asleep\" or \"dead\" states. These will operate "
"different actuators depending on the current state of the actor, and some"
" of these actuators may switch the actor's state under appropriate "
"conditions."

"States are set up and edited using the Controller (center) column of the "
"Game Logic Panel. To see the State panel, click on the State Panel Button"
" shown. The panel shows two areas for each of the 30 available states; "
"these show Visible states, and Initial states (see below). Setting up the"
" State system for a game is performed by choosing the appropriate state "
"for each controller in the object's logic."

"In the Visible area, each of the 30 available states is represented by a "

"toggle), and all State Panel squares are light-gray. Otherwise, "
"individual states can be clicked to make their logic visible. (Note that "
"you can click more than one square). Clicking the square again unselects "
"the state."

"States for the object that are in use (i.e. the object has controllers "
