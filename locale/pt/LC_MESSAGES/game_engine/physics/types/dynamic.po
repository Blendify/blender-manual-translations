"*Dynamic* objects give or receive collisions, but when they do so they "
"themselves do not rotate in response. So, a Dynamic ball will hit a ramp "
"and slide down, while a Rigid Body ball would begin rotating."

"If you do not need the rotational response the Dynamic type can save the "

"Note that these objects can still be rotated with :doc:`Logic Bricks "
"</game_engine/logic/index>` or Python code. Their physics meshes will "
"update when you do these rotations -- so collisions will be based on the "
"new orientations."
