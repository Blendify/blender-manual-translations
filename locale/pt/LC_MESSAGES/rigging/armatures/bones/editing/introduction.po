"These are standard editing methods, quite similar for example to "
":doc:`meshes </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` editing. Blender "
"also features a more advanced \"armature sketching\" tool, called "
":doc:`Etch-a-Ton </rigging/armatures/bones/editing/sketching>`. The same "

"One important thing to understand about armature editing is that you edit"
" the *rest position* of your armature, i.e. its \"default state\". An "
"armature in its *rest position* has all bones with *no* rotation and "
"scaled to 1.0 in their own local space."

"The different :doc:`poses </rigging/armatures/posing/index>` you might "
"create afterwards are based on this rest position. So if you modify it in"
" *Edit Mode*, all the poses already existing will also be modified. Thus "
"you should in general be sure that your armature is definitive before "
"starting to :doc:`skin </rigging/armatures/skinning/index>` and "
