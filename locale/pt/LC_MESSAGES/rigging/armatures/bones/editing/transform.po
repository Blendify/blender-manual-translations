"We will not detail here the various transformations of bones, nor things "
"like axis locking, pivot points, and so on, as they are common to most "
"object editing, and already described :doc:`here "
"</editors/3dview/object/transform/transform_control/index>` (note "
"however, that some options, like snapping, do not seem to work, even "
"though they are available...). The same goes for mirroring, as it is "
"nearly the same as with :doc:`mesh editing "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/transform/mirror>`. Just keep in mind that "
"bones' roots and tips behave more or less like meshes' vertices, and "
"bones themselves act like edges in a mesh."

" exactly as if they had no relations. They can be grabbed, rotated, "

"connected bones must always have parent's tips connected to child's "
"roots, so by transforming a bone, you will affect all its connected "

"When bones are displayed using *Octahedron*, *Stick* or *B-Bone* "
"visualizations, scaling will behave as expected, similar to scaling mesh "

" will have a different effect: it will scale the radius of the selected "
"bones's joints. (see: :doc:`skinning part "
"</rigging/armatures/skinning/index>`). As you control only one value (the"
" radius), there is no axis locking here. And as usual, with connected "
