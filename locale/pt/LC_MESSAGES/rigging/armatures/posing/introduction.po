"So, armatures in Blender have a third mode, *Pose*, dedicated to this "
"process. It is a sort of \"object mode for bones\". In rest position (as "
"edited in *Edit Mode*), each bone has its own position/rotation/scale to "
"neutral values (i.e. 0.0 for position and rotation, and 1.0 for scale). "
"Hence, when you edit a bone in *Pose Mode*, you create an offset in its "
"transform properties, from its rest position -- this is quite similar to "
":doc:`meshes relative shape keys </animation/shape_keys/index>`, in fact."
