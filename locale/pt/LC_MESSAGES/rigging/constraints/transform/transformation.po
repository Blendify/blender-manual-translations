msgid "This constraint is more complex and versatile than the other \"transform\" constraints. It allows you to map one type of transform properties (i.e. location, rotation or scale) of the target, to the same or another type of transform properties of the owner, within a given range of values (which might be different for each target and owner property). You can also switch between axes, and use the range values not as limits, but rather as \"markers\" to define a mapping between input (target) and output (owner) values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/transform/transformation.rst:15
msgid "So, e.g. you can use the position of the target along the X axis to control the rotation of the owner around the Z-Axis, stating that 1 BU along the target X-Axis corresponds to10 BU around the owner Z-Axis. Typical uses for this include gears (see note below), and rotation based on location setups."

msgid "By default, the *min* and *max* values bound the input and output values; all values outside these ranges are clipped to them. When you enable this button, the *min* and *max* values are no longer strict limits, but rather \"markers\" defining a proportional (linear) mapping between input and corresponding output values. Let us illustrate that with two graphs Fig. :ref:`fig-constraints-transformation-extrapolate`. In these pictures, the input range (in abscissa) is set to (1.0 to 4.0), and its corresponding output range (in ordinate), to (1.0 to 2.0). The yellow curve represents the mapping between input and output."
