msgid ""
"The maximum number of light bounces can be controlled manually. While "
"ideally this should be infinite, in practice a smaller number of bounces "
"may be sufficient, or some light interactions may be intentionally left "
"out for faster convergence. The number of diffuse reflection, glossy "
"reflection and transmission bounces can also be controlled individually."

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/settings/light_paths.rst:40
msgid ""
"Light paths are terminated probabilistically when specifying a minimum "
"number of light bounces lower than the maximum. In that case paths longer"
" than minimum will be randomly stopped when they are expected to "
"contribute less light to the image. This will still converge to the same "
"image, but renders faster while possibly being noisier."

msgid ""
"The transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "

"it, light passes straight on, as if there was no geometry there. The ray "
"type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent :abbr:`BSDF "
"(Bidirectional scattering distribution function)`. Other transmission "
":abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)` s are "
"considered opaque, because they change the light direction. As such they "
"cannot be used for alpha-over compositing, while this is possible with "
"the transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "
"function)`."

"The maximum number of transparent bounces is controlled separately from "
"other bounces. It is also possible to use probabilistic termination of "

"transparency."

"Note that while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was"
" hit, rendering performance is affected as each transparency step "

"This can be used, for example, to make an emitting mesh invisible to "
"camera rays. For duplicators, visibility is inherited; if the parent "
"object is hidden for some ray types, the children will be hidden for "
"these too."

"In terms of performance, using these options is more efficient that using"
" a shader node setup that achieves the same effect. Objects invisible to "
"a certain ray will be skipped in ray traversal already, leading to fewer "
"rays cast and shaders executed."
