msgid ""
"The transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution "
"function)` shader is given special treatment. When a ray passes through "
"it, light passes straight on, as if there was no geometry there. The ray "
"type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/introduction.rst:59
msgid ""
"Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF. Other "
"transmission BSDFs are considered opaque, because they change the light "
"direction. As such they cannot be used for alpha-over compositing, while "
"this is possible with the transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/introduction.rst:64
msgid ""
"Note that, while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry "
"was hit, rendering performance is affected as each transparency step "
"requires executing the shader and tracing a ray."
