"UV mapping is a very precise way of mapping a 2D texture to a 3D surface."
" Each vertex of a mesh has its own UV co-ordinates which can be unwrapped"

"mapping that works on a 2D plane with its own local coordinate system to "
"the plane on which it is operating on. This mapping is especially useful "
"when using 2D images as textures, as seen in :ref:`UV Mapping <editors-"
