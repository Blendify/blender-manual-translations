"Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing springs."
" Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one part of a "

" to another object. A clasp on a cloak could be created with a sewing "
"spring. The spring could pull two corners of a cloak about a character's "
