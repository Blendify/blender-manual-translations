"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric."
" So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some"
" good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several "
"times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode* and "
"subdivide the mesh a couple of times."

"Now, we will make this cloth by going to the Physics tab. Scroll down "
"until you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the *Cloth* button. Now, a lot"
" of settings will appear, most of which we will ignore for now."

"That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you"
" playback the animation, the drop of your newly created fabric will be "
"quite unspectacular. That is what we will cover in the next two sections "
"about pinning and colliding."

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid "
"shape and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or "
"so, and the flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* "
"Modifier. If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, "
