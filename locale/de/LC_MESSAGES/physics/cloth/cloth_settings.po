msgid "Cloth Sewing Springs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing springs."
" Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one part of a "
"cloth mesh toward vertices in another part of the cloth mesh. This is "
"different from pinning which binds vertices of the cloth mesh in place or"
" to another object. A clasp on a cloak could be created with a sewing "
"spring. The spring could  pull two corners of a cloak about a character's"
" neck. This could result in a more realistic simulation than pinning the "
"cloak to the character's neck since the cloak would be free to slide "
"about the character's neck and shoulders."

"Sewing springs are created by adding extra edges to a cloth mesh. These "

"vertices in the mesh that should be pulled together. For example the "
"corners of a cloak. The vertexes of these extra edges are added to a "
"vertex group."
