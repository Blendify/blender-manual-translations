"Don't be surprised, but you'll get whole bunch of mesh (.bobj.gz) files "
"after a simulation. One set for preview, and another for final. Each set has"
" a .gz file for each frame of the animation. Each file contains the "
"simulation result - so you'll need them."

"Currently these files will not be automatically deleted, so it is a good "
"idea to e.g. create a dedicated directory to keep simulation results. Doing "
"a fluid simulation is similar to clicking the *ANIM* button - you currently "
"have to take care of organizing the fluid surface meshes in some directory "
"yourself. If you want to stop using the fluid simulation, you can simply "
"delete all the ``*fluid*.bobj.gz`` files."

"Before running a high resolution simulation that might take hours, check the"
" overall timing first by doing lower resolution runs."

msgid ""
"Fluid objects must be completely inside the bounding box of the domain "
"object. If not, baking may not work correctly or at all. Fluid and obstacle "
"objects can be meshes with complex geometries. Very thin objects might not "
"appear in the simulation, if the chosen resolution is too coarse to resolve "
"them (increasing it might solve this problem)."

"Note that fluid simulation parameters, such as inflow velocity or the active"
" flag can be animated with *Fluidsim* Ipos (see above)."

"Don't try to do a complicated scene all at once. Blender has a powerful "
"compositor that you can use to combine multiple animations."

"For example, to produce an animation showing two separate fluid flows while "
"keeping your domain small, render one .avi using the one flow. Then move the"
" domain and render another .avi with the other flow using an alpha channel "
"(in a separate B&W .avi?). Then, composite both .avi's using the "
"compositor's add function. A third ``.avi`` is usually the smoke and mist "
"and it is laid on top of everything as well. Add a rain sheet on top of the "
"mist and spray and you'll have quite a storm brewing! And then lightning "
"flashes, trash blowing around, all as separate animations, compositing the "
"total for a truly spectacular result."

"- let me know: send the .blend file and a problem description to ``nils at "
