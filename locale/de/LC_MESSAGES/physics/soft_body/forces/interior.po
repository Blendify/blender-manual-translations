"To create a connection between the vertices of a Soft Body object there "
"have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are "
"effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the "
"vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. Image 1a illustrates how a "
"3×3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane in Blender) are connected in a Soft "
"Body simulation."

"But two vertices could freely rotate if you don't create additional edges"
" between them. Have you ever tried building a storage shelf out of 4 "
"planks alone? Well - don't do it, it will not be stable. The logical "
"method to keep a body from collapsing would be to create additional edges"
" between the vertices. This works pretty well, but would change your mesh"
" topology drastically."
