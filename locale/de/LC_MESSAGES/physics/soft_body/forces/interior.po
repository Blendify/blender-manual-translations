"In between each neighboring vertex of a mesh, you typically create edges "
"to connect them. Imagine each edge as a spring. Any mechanical spring is "
"able to stretch under tension, and to squeeze under pressure. All springs"
" have an ideal length, and a stiffness that limits how far you can "
"stretch or squeeze the spring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Blender's case, the ideal length is the original edge length which you"
" designed as a part of your mesh, even before you enable the Soft Body "
"system. Until you add the Soft Body physics, all springs are assumed to "
"be perfectly stiff: no stretch and no squeeze."

"To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there "
"have to be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are "
"effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the "
"vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-"
