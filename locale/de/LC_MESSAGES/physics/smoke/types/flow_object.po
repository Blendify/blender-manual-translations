"To define any mesh object as a *Smoke Flow* object, add smoke physics by "
"clicking *Smoke* in :menuselection:`Properties --> Physics`. Then select "
"*Flow* as the *Smoke Type*. Now you should have a default smoke flow "
"source object. You can test this by playing the animation (:kbd:`Alt-A`) "
"from the first frame. If your source object is inside your domain, you "
"should see smoke."
