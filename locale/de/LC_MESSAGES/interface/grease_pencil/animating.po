"Use the Grease Pencil to do basic pencil tests (e.g. 2D animation in "
"flipbook style). Sketches are stored on the frame that they were drawn "
"on, as a separate drawing (only on the layer that they exist on). Each "

"The only exception to this is the first drawing for a layer, which will "
"also be visible before the frame it was drawn on."
