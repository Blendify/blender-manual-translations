"Blender uses a novel screen-splitting approach to arrange window frames. The"
" application window is always a rectangle on your desktop. It divides it up "
"into a number of re-sizable window frames. A window frame contains the "
"workspace for a particular type of window, like a 3D View window, or an "
"Outliner. The idea is that you split up that big application window into any"
" number of smaller (but still rectangular) non-overlapping window frames. "
"That way, each window is always fully visible, and it is very easy to work "
"in one window and hop over to work in another."

"You can maximize a window frame to fill the whole application window with "
"the *View* --> *Toggle Full Screen* menu entry. To return to normal size, "
"use again *View* --> *Toggle Full Screen*. A quicker way to achieve this is "
"to use :kbd:`Shift-Spacebar`, :kbd:`Ctrl-Down` or :kbd:`Ctrl-Up` to toggle "
"between maximized and framed windows. NOTE: The window your mouse is "
"currently hovering over is the one that will be maximized using the keyboard"
" shortcuts."

"In the upper right and lower left corners of a window are the window "
"splitter widgets, and they look like a little ridged thumb grip. It both "
"splits and combines window panes. When you hover over it, your cursor will "
"change to a cross. :kbd:`LMB` and drag it to the left to split the window "
"pane vertically, or downward to split it horizontally."

"In order to merge two window frames, they must be the same dimension in the "
"direction you wish to merge. For example, if you want to combine two window "
"frames that are side-by-side, they must be the same height. If the one on "
"the left is not the same as the one on the right, you will not be able to "
"combine them horizontally. This is so that the combined window space results"
" in a rectangle. The same rule holds for joining two window frames that are "
"stacked on top of one another; they must both have the same width. If the "
"one above is split vertically, you must first merge those two, and then join"
" the bottom one up to the upper one."

"To merge the current window with the one above it (in the picture the "
"properties window is being merged \"over\" the Outliner), hover the mouse "
"pointer over the window splitter. When the pointer changes to a cross, "
":kbd:`LMB` click and drag up to begin the process of combining. The upper "
"window will get a little darker, overlaid with an arrow pointing up. This "
"indicates that the lower (current) frame will \"take over\" that darkened "
"frame space. Let go of the :kbd:`LMB` to merge. If you want the reverse to "
"occur, move your mouse cursor back into the original (lower) frame, and it "
"will instead get the arrow overlay."
