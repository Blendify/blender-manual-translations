"All windows have a header (the strip with a lighter gray background "
"containing icon buttons). We will also refer to the header as the window "
"*ToolBar*. The header may be at the top (as with the *Properties Window*)"
" or the bottom (as with the *3D Window*) of a window's area. The picture "
"below shows the header of the 3D window:"

"If you move the mouse over a window, its header changes to a slightly "
"lighter shade of gray. This means that it is \"focused\". All hotkeys you"
" press will now affect the contents of this window."

"To hide a header, move your mouse over the thin line between a window and"
" its header, until the pointer takes the form of an up/down arrow. Then "
"click, hold and drag with :kbd:`LMB` from the window over the header to "

"Blender allows for most of its interface color settings to be changed to "
"suit the needs of the user. If you find that the colors you see on screen"
" do not match those mentioned in the Manual then it could be that your "

"selecting/altering a pre-existing one can be done by selecting the "
":doc:`User Preferences </preferences/index>` window and clicking on the "
"*Themes* tab of the window."
