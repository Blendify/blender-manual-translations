"Rigging makes animation possible. Without a good rig animation is incredibly"
" frustrating. Imagine animating a bouncing ball without the ability to "
"squash it against the ground? Try animating a monkey swinging through the "
"trees with no control to make the monkey's hands grab onto the branches. "
"What if you had to animate an army tank speeding through the desert by "
"positioning each tread on the tank one at a time?"

"Rigging solves motion problems. For example, the first door below doesn't "
"move correctly. It needs to be rigged. Door 2 solves the problem by "
"repositioning the :term:`Object Center` of the door. Door 3 solves the "
"problem by :term:`Parenting` the door to an :term:`Empty`. Door 4 solves the"
" problem by :term:`Weight Painting` all of its :term:`Vertices` to an "
":term:`Armature`."

"Rigging is a discipline that takes practice. Start by building simple rigs "
"(like a bouncing ball, a tumbling box, an odometer, a clock). Stay humble. "
"Stay patient. Study the fundamental concepts that make a bouncing ball "
"bounce. Add one rigging tool to your toolbox at a time. Test your simple "
"rigs in actual animation projects. And only after much trial and error, "
"consider putting everything together into the sophisticated character rig of"
" your dreams."
