"The *Shrinkwrap* constraint is the \"object counterpart\" of the "
":doc:`Shrinkwrap modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/shrinkwrap>`. It moves"
" the owner origin and therefore the owner object's location to the surface "
"of its target."

msgid ""
"This implies that the target *must* have a surface. In fact, the constraint "
"is even more selective, as it can only use meshes as targets. Hence, the "
"*Shrinkwrap* option is only shown in the *Add Constraint to Active Object* "
"menu, :kbd:`Ctrl-Alt-C`, (or its bone's equivalent), when the selected "
"inactive object is a mesh."

"This numeric field controls the offset of the owner from the shrunk computed"
" position on the target's surface. Positive values place the owner "
"\"outside\" of the target, and negative ones, \"inside\" the target. This "
"offset is applied along the straight line defined by the original (i.e. "
"before constraint) position of the owner, and the computed one on the "
"target's surface."

"The target's surface's point is determined by projecting the owner's center "
"along a given axis. This axis is controlled by the three *X*, *Y* and *Z* "
"toggle buttons that show up when you select this type. This mean the "
"projection axis can only be aligned with one of the global axes, median to "
"both of them (XY, XZ or YZ), or to the three ones (XYZ). When the projection"
" of the owner's center along the selected direction does not hit the "
"target's surface, the owner's location is left unchanged."
