msgid ""
"The *Floor* constraint allows you to use its target position (and "
"optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where "
"the owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In "
"other words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it "
"is only capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the "
"*Vertex Group* option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or walls."

"This set of (mutually exclusive) buttons controls which plane will be the"
" \"floor\". The buttons' names correspond indeed to the *normal* to this "
"plane (e.g. enabling Z means \"XY plane\", etc.) By default, these "
"normals are aligned with the *global* axes. However, if you enable *Use "
"Rotation* (see above), they will be aligned with the *local target's "
"axes*. As the constraint does not only define an uncrossable plane, but "
"also a side of it which is forbidden to the owner, you can choose which "
"side by enabling either the positive or negative normal axis... e.g. by "
"default Z, the owner is stuck in the positive Z coordinates."
