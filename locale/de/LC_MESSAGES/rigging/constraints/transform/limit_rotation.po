"An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This constraint"
" restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, through lower "
"and upper bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual "
"and rendered rotations of its owner, its owner's data block still allows (by"
" default) the object or bone to have rotation values outside the minimum and"
" maximum ranges. This can be seen in the *Transform Properties* panel "
"(:kbd:`N`). When an owner is rotated and attempted to be rotated outside the"
" limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and "
"when rendered, but internally, its rotation values will still be changed "
"beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to "
"jump to its internally specified rotation."

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal rotation that is beyond the limit, "
"rotating it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the "
"internal rotation values are back within the limit threshold (unless you "
"enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's rotation "

"Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier."

"owner transform properties are also limited by the constraint. Note however "
"that the constraint does not directly modifies the rotation values: you have"
" to rotate one way or the other its owner, for this to take effect..."
