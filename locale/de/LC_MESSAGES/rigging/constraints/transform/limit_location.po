"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the X, Y"
" and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed translations "
"along each axis, through lower and upper bounds."

"The limits for an object are calculated from its center, and the limits of a"

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual "
"and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data block still allows (by "
"default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the minimum and "
"maximum ranges. This can be seen in its *Transform Properties* panel "
"(:kbd:`N`). When an owner is grabbed and attempted to be moved outside the "
"limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and "
"when rendered, but internally, its coordinates will still be changed beyond "
"the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump to "
"its internally specified location."

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the limits, "
"dragging it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the "
"internal coordinates are back within the limit threshold (unless you enabled"
" the *For Transform* option, see below)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's movement "
"along that axis... Although this is possible, using the *Transformation "
"Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier!"

"These buttons enable the lower boundary for the location of the owner's "

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can "
"still have coordinates out of bounds (as shown by the *Transform Properties*"

"however that the constraint does not directly modify the coordinates: you "
"have to grab its owner one way or another for this to take effect..."
