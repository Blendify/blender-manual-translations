"In Blender *Actions* are a generic containers for F-Curves. Actions can "
"contain any number of F-Curves, and can be attached to any data block. As"
" long as the RNA data paths stored in the Action's F-Curves can be found "
"on that data block, the animation will work. For example, an action "
"modifying 'X location' and 'Y location' properties can be shared across "
"multiple objects, since both objects have 'X location' and 'Y location' "
"properties beneath them."

"The *Action Editor* window enables you to see and edit the FCurve data-"
"blocks you defined as actions in the *FCurve Editor* window. So it takes "
"place somewhere in-between the low-level :doc:`FCurves "
"</editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, and the high-level :doc:`NLA "
"editor </editors/nla>`. Hence, you do not have to use them for simple Ipo"
" curves animations - and they have not much interest in themselves, so "
"you will mostly use this window when you do :doc:`NLA animation "
"</editors/nla>` (they do have a few specific usages on their own, though,"
" like e.g. with the :doc:`Action constraint "
"</rigging/constraints/relationship/action>`, or the :doc:`pose libraries "
"</rigging/posing/pose_library>`)."

"This is not a mandatory window, as you do can edit the actions used by "
"the NLA directly in the *FCurve Editor* window (or even the *NLA Editor* "
"one). However, it gives you a slightly simplified view of your FCurve "
"data-blocks (somewhat similar to the \"key\" mode of the FCurve window, "
"even though more powerful in some ways) - and, more interesting, it can "
"show you all \"action\" FCurve data-blocks of a same object at once."

"Each \"action\" FCurve data-block forms a top-level channel (see below). "
"Note that an object can have several *Constraint* (one per animated "
"constraint) and *Pose* (for armatures, one per animated bone) FCurve "
"data-blocks, and hence an action can have several of these channels."

"As everything else in Blender, actions are data-blocks. Unlike FCurve "
"ones, there is only one type of action, which can regroup all FCurve of a"
" given object. You'll find its usual data-block controls in the *Action "
"Editor* header."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/dope_sheet/action.rst:46
msgid ""
"However, there is one specificity with action data-blocks: they have by "
"default a \"fake user\", i.e. once created, they are always kept in "
"Blender file, even if no object uses them. This is due to the fact that "
"actions are designed to be used in the NLA, where you can affect several "
"different actions to a same object! Yes, this is the only way to use "
"different actions (and hence, different FCurve data-blocks of the same "
"kind) to animate a same object. But as you have to assign an action to an"
" object to be able to edit it (and an object can only have one action "
"data-block at a time), to have \"fake users\" guaranties you that you "
"won't lost your precious previously-edited actions when you start working"
" on a new one!"

"This window shows, by default, the action data-block linked to the "
"current active object. However, as with FCurvs, you can pin an *Action "
"Editor* to a given action with the small \"pin\" button to the left of "
"the data-block controls, in the header. This will force the window to "
"always display this data-block, whatever the current selected object is."
