"Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow "
"to mask out, or influence a particular object in the footage. They can be"
" used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the "
"footage, or as a rough matte for green screen keying. Masks are "
"independent from a particular image of movie clip, and so they can just "
"as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the "
"compositor. These masks can also be used in other places in Blender."

"Masks can be created in the image and movie clip editors, by changing the"
" mode from View to Mask in the header. This will add various tools and "
"properties to the editor panels, while hiding others that are not needed "
"for interacting with masks. The tools and panels available to edit masks "
"are the same in both editors, with the exception that linking masks to "
"motion tracking data is only possible in the movie clip editor."

"Once set to Mask mode, a Mask data-block can be added. Any image, movie "
"clip, render or compositing result can be used as a backdrop to draw "
"masks over. To get interactive feedback on the resulting mask, a Mask "
"node can be connected directly to a Viewer node in the compositor, which "
"will then keep updating the compositing result while editing."

"The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, "
"but with some differences. The curve needed to support feathering in a "
"way that stuck to the curve as you edited it, for ease of editing an "
"animation. These are called S-Curves."

"Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the "
"feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each "
"feather point is stored in UV space, where U means position across spline"
" segment, and V means distance between main spline and feather points."

"This allows for deforming the main spline in almost any way, and the "
"feather will be updated automatically to reflect that change. For example"
" if there is just rotation of the spline, feather would stay completely "
"unchanged. If one point's feather is moved, the other feathers will be "
"automatically stretched uniformly along that segment and the overall "
"shape will be almost the same as artists would want it to be."

"Editing of mask splines happens in a way similar to editing Bézier curves"
" or paths in GIMP or other curve editors: control points are added to "
"define the spline itself, and handles of different types are used to "
"create smooth bends. This makes it possible to define a mask with few "
"points to easily follow an object in footage."
