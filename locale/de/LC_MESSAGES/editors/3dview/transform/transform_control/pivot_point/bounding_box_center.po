"The bounding box is a rectangular box that is wrapped as tightly as possible"
" around the selection. It is oriented parallel to the world axes. In this "
"mode the pivot point lies at the center of the bounding box. You can set the"
" pivot point to bounding box with the :kbd:`,` hotkey or via the menu in the"
" *Window Header*. The image below shows how the Object's Bounding Box size "
"is determined by the size of the Object."
