"The Median Point can be considered to be broadly similar to the concept "
"of Center of Gravity (COG). If we assume that every element (Object, "
"face, vertex etc) of the selection has the same mass, the median point "
"would sit at the point of equilibrium for the selection (the COG)."

"In Object Mode, Blender only considers the Object centers when "
"determining the median point. This can lead to some counterintuitive "
"results. In the Fig. Object Mode median points image below, you can see "
"that the median point is between the Object centers and can be nowhere "
"near the Objects' mesh."

"In Edit Mode, the median point is determined via the part of the "
"selection that has the most elements. For example, in the Fig. Median "
"points in Edit Mode, when there are two cubes with an equal number of "
"vertices, the median point lies directly between the two cubes. However, "
"if we subdivide one cube multiple times so that it has many more "
"vertices, you can see that the median point has shifted to the region "
"with the most vertices."
