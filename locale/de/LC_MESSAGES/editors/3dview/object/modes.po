"*Modes* are a Blender-level object-oriented feature, which means that *the "
"whole Blender application* is always in *one and only one mode*, and that "
"the available modes vary depending on the selected active object's type - "
"most of them only enable the default *Object* mode (like cameras, lamps, "
"etc.). Each mode is designed to edit an aspect of the selected object. See "
"the *Blender's Modes* table below for details."
