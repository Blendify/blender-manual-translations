"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video."
" There are two possible methods for this one being the :doc:`Compositor "
"</compositing/introduction>`. However, this chapter is on the other, the "
"Video Sequence Editor (VSE) and some time shorten to just Sequencer. The "
"Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows "
"you to combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can "
"use these effects to create powerful video edits (especially when you "
"combine it with the animation power of Blender!)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/sequencer/introduction.rst:13
msgid ""
"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or"
" in some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link "
"the end of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can audio "
"and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."

"The Video Sequence Editor has a header (where the menu and view modes are"
" shown) and a workspace, and works in one of several view modes. The "
"Marker menu allows you to add markers in the VSE. Markers are shared "
"across animation editors. See :doc:`Markers </animation/markers>`"

"The sequencer workspace is horizontally striped into channels and each "
"video strip will go in a horizontal channel. Each channel is numbered on "
"the left-hand side, starting from zero and going up."
msgstr ""

"The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips. This is because"
" it is used by the :doc:`Sequencer Display "
"</editors/sequencer/display_modes>` to show a composite of all strips "
"above channel 0."

"Stripes toward the bottom are more dominant, which we will get to in a "
"minute. In the x direction, seconds of animation or frames of animation ,"
" :kbd:`Ctrl-T` to choose, are used as the measure of time (seconds 1 "
"through 7 are shown). You can scale the time using the zoom keys or mouse"
" actions (see the Reference for more info)."
