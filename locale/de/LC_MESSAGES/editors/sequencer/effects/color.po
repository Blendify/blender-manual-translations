"This effect works by itself to create a color strip. By default, when it is "
"created, it is 50 frames long, but you can extend it by grabbing and moving "
"one of the ends. Click on the color swatch in the Effect panel under "
"Sequencer buttons, which is under the Scene tab, to pick a different color "
"(by default, it is gray). Use this strip crossed with your main movie to "
"provide a fade-in or fade-out."
