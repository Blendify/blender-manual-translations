"Vertex Groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a"
" Mesh Object or :term:`Lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the "
"hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character."
" In addition you can assign different *weight values* (in the range [ "
"0.0, 1.0 ] ) to the vertices within a Vertex Group. Hence Vertex Groups "
"are sometimes also named *Weight Groups*."

#~ " contains the vertices of this part"
#~ " at full weight (*1.0*), and when "
#~ "reaching the elbow area, these weights"
#~ " decrease progressively to *0.0* when "
#~ "reaching the forearm zone and vice "
#~ "versa for the forearm group weights..."
#~ " Of course, this is a very raw"

#~ "is a big job, as you have to"
