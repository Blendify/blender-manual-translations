"When a *ParticleInstance* modifier is added to an object, that object will "

"Because of the co-dependant way in which the *ParticleInstance* modifier is "
"influenced by the underlying particle systems on other objects, some of the "
"apparent effects generated by the *ParticleInstance* modifier can look and "
"act vastly different, depending on the underlying settings of the particle "
"systems it is associated with. This is worth taking account of if the "
"*ParticleInstance* modifier settings don't appear to be giving the results "
"expected, as it may indicate that the particle system settings may need "
"altering rather than the *ParticleInstance* modifier settings."
