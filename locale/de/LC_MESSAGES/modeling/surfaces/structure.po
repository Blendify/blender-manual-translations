"Many of the concepts from :doc:`curves </modeling/curves/introduction>`, "

"surfaces, such as control points, *Order*, *Weight*, *Resolution*, etc. "
"Here we will just talk about the differences."

"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves "
"and NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. "
"Blender internally treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely "
"differently. There are several attributes that separate them but the most"
" important is that a NURBS curve has a single interpolation axis (U) and "
"a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V)."

"However, you can have \"2D\" surfaces made of curves (using the "
":doc:`extrusion tools </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, or, to a "
"lesser extent, the filling of closed 2D curves). And you can have \"1D\" "
"curves made of surfaces, like a NURBS surface with only one row (either "
"in U or V direction) of control points produces only a curve..."

"Visually you can tell which is which by entering *Edit Mode* and looking "
"at the 3D View header: either the header shows *Surface* or *Curve* as "
"one of the menu choices. Also, you can :doc:`extrude "
"</modeling/curves/properties/geometry>` a whole NURBS surface curve to "
"create a surface, but you cannot with a simple NURBS curve."

"Control points for NURBS surfaces are the same as for NURBS curves. "
"However, their layout is quite constraining. The concept of \"segment\" "
"disappears, replaced by \"rows\" and the overall \"grid\"."

msgid ""
"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one "
"interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-"
"mesh-structure-edge-loops>` for meshes). So you have \"U rows\" and \"V "
"rows\" in a NURBS surface. The key point is that *all* rows of a given "
"type (U or V) have the *same* number of control points. Each control "
"point belongs to exactly one U row and one V row."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/surfaces/structure.rst:44

"All this forms a \"grid\", or \"cage\", the shape of which controls the "
"shape of the NURBS surface. A bit like a :doc:`lattice "
"</animation/lattice>`..."

msgid ""
"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to"
" a NURBS surface; you have to add a whole U or V row at once (in "
"practice, you will usually use the *Extrude* tool, or perhaps the "
"*Duplicate* one, to add those...), containing exactly the same number of "
"points as the others. This also means that you will only be able to "
"\"merge\" different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows "
"matches together."

#: ../../manual/modeling/surfaces/structure.rst:59
msgid ""
"Similar to :ref:`NURBS Splines <curve-nurbs>` NURBS Surface control "
"points have a weight property. This weight property controls how much "
"influence the control point has on the surface. This weight should not be"
" confused with the :ref:`Goal Weight <surface-goal-weight>`, which is "
"used only for soft body simulations. The NURBS control point weight can "
"be adjusted in the *W* number field of the :doc:`Transform panel "
"</modeling/curves/editing/transform_panel>`."

"In Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-weight` a single control point, labeled "
"\"C\", has had its *Weight* set to 5.0 while all others are at their "
"default of 1.0. As you can see, that control point *pulls* the surface "
"towards it."

"If all the control points have the same *Weight* then each effectively "

"NURBS can create pure shapes such as circles, cylinders, and spheres "

"NURBS before trying this."

"To create a sphere with 2D surfaces, its the same principle as with a 2D "
"circle. You will note that the four different weights needed for creating"
