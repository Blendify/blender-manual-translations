"The COLLADAâ„¢ module has been implemented as a flexible tool for exporting"
" and importing ``.dae`` files. A design goal is to provide a set of "
"parameters which should make it possible to export/import Collada files "
"from/to a variety of tools. But please be aware that the Collada module "
"is still a work in progress. So it may be possible that your particular "
"usage scenario is not yet supported."
