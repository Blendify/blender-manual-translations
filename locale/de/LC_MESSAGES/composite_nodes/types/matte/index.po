msgid ""
"These nodes give you the essential tools for working with blue-screen or "
"green-screen footage, where live action is shot in front of a blue or green "
"backdrop for replacement by a matte painting or virtual background."

"In general, hook up these nodes to a viewer, set your UV/Image Editor to "
"show the viewer node, and play with the sliders in real-time using a sample "
"image from the footage, to get the settings right. In some cases, small "
"adjustments can eliminate artifacts or foreground image degredation. For "
"example, taking out too much green can result in foreground actors looking "
"'flat' or blueish/purplish."

"You can and should chain these nodes together, refining your color "
"correction in successive refinements, using each node's strengths to operate"
" on the previous node's output. There is no \"one stop shopping\" or one "
"\"does-it-all\" node; they work best in combination."

"Usually, green screen is shot in a stage with consistent lighting from shot "
"to shot, so the same settings will work across multiple shots of raw "
"footage. Footage shot outside under varying lighting conditions (and wind "
"blowing the background) will complicate matters and mandate lower falloff "
"values."

msgid "Garbage Matte"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/composite_nodes/types/matte/index.rst:32
msgid ""
"Garbage matte is not a node, but a technique where the foreground is "
"outlined using a closed curve (bezier or nurbs). Only the area within the "
"curve is processed using these matte nodes; everything else is garbage and "
"thus discarded."
