"The Bokeh Blur node generates a bokeh type blur similar to Defocus. Unlike "
"defocus an in-focus region is defined in the compositor. There is also more "
"flexibility in the type of blur applied through the :doc:`Bokeh "
"Image</composite_nodes/types/input/bokeh_image>` node."

"Size controls the amount of blur. Size can either be a single value across "
"the entire image or a variable value controlled by an input image. In order "
"to use the latter the Variable Size option must be selected. See the "
"examples section below for more on how to use this."

"This can be used with a :doc:`Box "
"Mask</composite_nodes/types/matte/box_mask>` matte node or with a "
":doc:`Mask</composite_nodes/types/input/mask>` input node to restrict the "
"area of the image the blur is applied to. This could be helpful, for "
"example, when developing a node system by allowing only a small area of the "
"image to be filtered thus saving composite time each time adjustments are "
"made."
