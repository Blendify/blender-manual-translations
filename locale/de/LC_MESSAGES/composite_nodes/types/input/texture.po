"You can change the *Offset* and a *Scale* (which is called Offs XYZ and Size"
" XYZ in the Materials Texture Map Input panel) for the texture by clicking "
"on the label and setting the sliders, thus affecting how the texture is "
"applied to the image. For animation, note that this is a vector input "
"socket, because the XYZ values are needed."

"In the example above, we want to simulate some red plasma gas out there in "

"take the ever-so-useful Cloud texture and use it to mix in red with the "
