"Switch between two images using a checkbox. When the checkbox is checked, "
"the 'On' input is output. When it is unchecked the 'Off' input is output "
"instead. Switch state may be animated by adding a :doc:`keyframe "
"</animation/key_frames>` This makes the Switch node useful for bypassing "
"nodes which are not wanted during part of a sequence."
