"This node scales the size of an image. Scaling can be either absolute or "
"relative. If Absolute toggle is on, you can define the size of an image by "
"using real pixel values. In relative mode percents are used."

"For instance X: ``0.5`` and Y: ``0.5`` would produce image which width and "
"height would be half of what they used to be. When expanding an image "
"greatly, you might want to blur it somewhat to remove the square corners "
"that might result. Unless of course you want that effect; in which case, "
"ignore what I just said."

"Use this node to match image sizes. Most nodes produce an image that is the "
"same size as the image input into their top image socket. So, if you want to"
" uniformly combine two images of different size, you must scale the second "
"to match the resolution of the first."
