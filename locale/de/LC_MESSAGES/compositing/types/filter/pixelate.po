"In the node editor, set the node tree to compositing in the menu bar and "
"check the 'Use Nodes' checkbox. Add an input Image node and an output Viewer"
" node. Connect the Input node to the viewer node and check the 'Backdrop' "
"checkbox in the menu bar. Open an image you would like to pixelate using the"
" open button on the image node. This image should now appear in the "
"backdrop. Now add two scale nodes between the input and output "
"(Add>Distort>Scale). Change the values of X and Y to 0.2 in the first scale "
"box and to 5 in the second. The background image will be unchanged."
