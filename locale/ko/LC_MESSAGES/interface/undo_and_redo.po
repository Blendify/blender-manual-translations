"*Redo Last* is short for *Redo(ing the) Last (Action)*. :kbd:`F6` after "

"For example, if your last action was a rotation in *Object Mode*, Blender"
" will show you the last value changed for the angle (see Fig. :ref:`fig-"
"interface-redo-last` left), where you can change your action back "
"completely by typing :kbd:`Numpad0`. There are other useful options, "
"based on your action context, and you cannot only Undo actions, but "
"change them completely using the available options."

"First positions correspond to most recent actions. A small icon of an eye"

"time with *Undo* and then forward with *Redo*, you can hop around on the "
"Undo timeline as much as you want as long as you do not make a new "
"change. Once you do make a new change, the Undo History is truncated at "
