"The *Follow Path* constraint places its owner onto a *curve* target "
"object, and makes it move along this curve (or path). It can also affect "
"its owner's rotation to follow the curve's bends, when the *Follow Curve*"
" option is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "The owner is always evaluated in the global (world) space:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:15
msgid ""
"Its location (as shown in the *Transform* panel) is used as an offset "
"from its normal position on the path. E.g. if you have an owner with the "
"(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) location, it will be one BU away from its normal position"
" on the curve, along the X and Y axis. Hence, if you want your owner *on*"
" its target path, clear its location :kbd:`Alt-G`!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:20
msgid ""
"This location offset is also proportionally affected by the scale of the "
"target curve. Taking the same (1.0, 1.0, 0.0) offset as above, if the "
"curve has a scale of (2.0, 1.0, 1.0), the owner will be offset *two* BU "
"along the X axis (and one along the Y one)..."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:24
msgid ""
"When the *Curve Follow* option is enabled, its rotation is also offset to"
" the one given by the curve (i.e. if you want the Y axis of your object "
"to be aligned with the curve's direction, it must be in rest, non-"
"constrained state, aligned with the global Y axis). Here again, clearing "
"your owner's rotation :kbd:`Alt-R` might be useful..."

"The movement of the owner along the target curve/path may be controlled "
"in two different ways:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:31
msgid ""
"The most simple is to define the number of frames of the movement, in the"
" Path Animation panel of the Object Data tab, via the number button "
"Frames, and its start frame via the constraint's Offset option (by "
"default, start frame: 1 [= offset of 0)], duration: 100)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:35
msgid ""
"The second way, much more precise and powerful, is to define a "
"*Evaluation Time* interpolation curve for the *Target* path (in the "
"*Graph Editor*. See the :doc:`animation chapter </animation/index>` to "
"learn more about F-Curves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:38
msgid ""
"If you do not want your owner to move along the path, you can give to the"
" target curve a flat *Speed* F-Curve (its value will control the position"
" of the owner along the path)."

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:41
msgid ""
"*Follow Path* is another constraint that works well with the :doc:`Locked"
" Track one </rigging/constraints/tracking/locked_track>`. One example is "
"a flying camera on a path. To control the camera's roll angle, you can "
"use a *Locked Track* and a target object to specify the up direction, as "
"the camera flies along the path."

msgid ""
"Do not confuse these two constraints. Both of them constraint the "
"location of their owner along a curve, but *Follow Path* is an "
"\"animation-only\" constraint, inasmuch that the position of the owner "
"along the curve is determined by the time (i.e. current frame), whereas "
"the :doc:`Clamp To </rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to>` *constraint*"
" determines the position of its owner along the curve using one of its "
"location properties' values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path.rst:56
msgid ""
"Note that you also need to keyframe Evaluation Time for the Path. Select "
"the path, go to the path properties, set the overall frame to the first "
"frame of the path (e.g. frame 1), set the value of Evaluation time to the"
" first frame of the path (e.g. 1), right click on Evaluation time, select"
" create keyframe, set the overall frame to the last frame of the path "
"(e.g. frame 100), set the value of Evaluation time to the last frame of "
"the path (e.g. 100), right click on Evaluation time, select create "
