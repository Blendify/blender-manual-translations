"The Target field lets you link the constraint to a Target object of your "
"choosing. This link provides data to the constraint so that it can begin "
"to function. For example, the Copy Location Constraint needs location "
"data to function. Fill in the Target field, and the Copy Location "
"constraint will begin to use location data from the Target object."

"If the Target field links to a :term:`Mesh` or :term:`Lattice` object, a "

"If the Target field links to an :term:`Armature`, a :term:`Bone` field "
"will appear along with a :term:`Head` or :term:`Tail` slider. Enter the "
"name of a bone and the constraint will target the bone instead of the "
"entire armature object center. Slide the slider and the constraint will "
"target the head, the tail or somewhere inbetween."
