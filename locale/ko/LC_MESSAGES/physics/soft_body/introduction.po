"Soft body simulation is used for simulating soft deformable objects. It "
"was designed primarily for adding secondary motion to animation, like "
"jiggle for body parts of a moving character."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:10
msgid ""
"It also works for simulating more general soft objects that bend, deform "
"and react to forces like gravity and wind, or collide with other objects."

"While it can simulate cloth and other stiff types of deformable objects "
"to an extent, the :doc:`Cloth Simulation </physics/cloth/index>` can do "
"it better with a solver specifically designed for this purpose."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/soft_body/introduction.rst:17
msgid ""
"The simulation works by combining existing animation on the object with "
"forces acting on it. There are exterior forces like gravity or force "
"fields and interior forces that hold the vertices together. This way you "
"can simulate the shapes that an object would take on in reality if it had"
" volume, was filled with something, and was acted on by real forces."
