"A *Charge* force field is similar to spherical field except it changes "
"behavior (attract/repulse) based on the effected particles charge field "
"(negative/positive), like real particles with a charge. This mean this "
"field has only effect on particles that have also a *Charge* field (else,"
" they have no \"charge\", and hence are unaffected)!"
