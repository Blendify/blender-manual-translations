"In a *Harmonic* force field, the source of the force field is the zero "
"point of a harmonic oscillator (spring, pendulum). If you set the "
"*Damping* parameter to 1, the movement is stopped in the moment the "
"object is reached. This force field is really special if you assign it to"
" particles."

"Normally every particle of the field system influences every particle of "

"assigned to a field particle. So particles will move to the place of "
"other particles, thus forming shapes."
