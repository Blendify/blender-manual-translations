"The dope sheet view is used to visualize motion tracking data, it "
"implemented as separate view of the movie clip editor just like the "
":doc:`Graph View </editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/graph>`. To support"
" this in a nice way, you must toggle between modes specified to a view in"
" the whole area of the movie clip editor. Hence, to display a curve or "
"dope sheet view, the editor must be split into two, with one switched to "
"the curve or dope sheet view."

"Currently the dope sheet view is for visualization and does not have any "
"tools to actually edit data. It displays channels for selected tracks and"
" each channel visualizes tracked segments of tracks as dark bars and "
"keyframed positions of tracks as small diamonds."
