"In CGI, texture mapping is a method to add detail to surfaces by "
"projecting images and patterns onto those surfaces. The projected images "
"and patterns can be set to affect not only color, but also specularity, "
"reflection, transparency, and even fake 3-dimensional depth. Most often, "
"the images and patterns are projected during render time, but texture "
"mapping is also used to sculpt, paint and deform objects."

"The material settings that we've seen so far produce smooth, *uniform* "
"objects, but such objects are not particularly true to reality, where "
"uniformity tends to be uncommon and out of place. In order to deal with "
"this unrealistic uniformity, Blender allows the user to apply *textures* "
"which can modify the reflectivity, specularity, roughness and other "
"surface qualities of a material."

"Textures are like additional layers on top of the base material. Textures"
" affect one or more aspects of the object's net coloring. The net color "

"This notion of using *more than one* texture, to achieve a combined "
"effect, is one of the \"hidden secrets\" of creating realistic-looking "
"objects. If you carefully \"look at the light\" while examining any real-"
"life object, you will observe that the final appearance of that object is"
" best described as the combination, in different ways and in different "
"amounts, of several distinct underlying visual characteristics. These "
"characteristics might be more (or less) strongly apparent at different "
"angles, under different lighting conditions, and so forth. Blender allows"
" you to achieve this in many ways."
