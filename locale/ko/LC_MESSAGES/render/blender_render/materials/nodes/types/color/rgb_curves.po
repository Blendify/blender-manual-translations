"In this example, the White Level is set to the color of a bright spot of "
"the sand in the background, and the Black Level to the color in the "
"center of the fish's eye. To do this efficiently it is best to bring up "
"the UV/Image editor showing the original input image. You can then use "
"the levels' color picker to easily choose the appropriate colors from the"
" input image, zooming into pixel level if necessary. The result can be "
"fine-tuned with the R, G, and B curves like in the previous example."

"Note that e.g. setting Black Level to red and White Level to blue does "
"not simply substitute black with red and white with blue as the example "
"image might suggest. Levels do color scaling, not substitution, but "
"depending on the settings they can result in the described color "
"substitution."

"(What really happens when setting Black Level to pure red and White Level"
" to pure blue is that the red channel gets inverted, green gets reduced "
"to zero and blue remains unchanged.)"
