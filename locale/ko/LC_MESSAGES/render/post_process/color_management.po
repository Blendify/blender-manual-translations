"For correct results, different color spaces are needed for rendering, "
"display and storage of images. Rendering and compositing is best done in "
"scene *linear* color space, which corresponds more closely to nature, and"

"If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality we double the "
"amount of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if"
" we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those"
" images together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with "
"both lights on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is "
"best for photo-realistic rendering and compositing."

"However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or "
"the way display devices work, and image files are often stored in "

"There is also an artistic choice to be made for renders. Partially that "
"is because display devices cannot display the full spectrum of colors and"
