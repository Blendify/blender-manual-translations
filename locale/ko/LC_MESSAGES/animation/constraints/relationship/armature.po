"*Armature* is the constraint version of the :ref:`Armature Modifier "
"<bpy.types.ArmatureModifier>`, exactly reproducing the weight-blended "
"bone transformations and applying it to its owner orientation. It can be "
"used like a variant of the :ref:`Child Of <bpy.types.ChildOfConstraint>` "
"constraint that can handle multiple parents at once, but requires all of "
"them to be bones."
