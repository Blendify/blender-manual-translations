"The *Follow Path* constraint places its owner onto a *curve* target "

"its owner's rotation to follow the curve's bends, when the *Follow Curve*"
" option is enabled."

"Its location (as shown in the *Transform* panel) is used as an offset "

"(1.0, 1.0, 0.0) location, it will be one unit away from its normal "
