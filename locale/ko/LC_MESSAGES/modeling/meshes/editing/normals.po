"As seen in the previous sections, polygons are central to Blender. Most "
"objects are represented by polygons and truly curved objects are often "
"approximated by polygon meshes. When rendering images, you may notice "
"that these polygons appear as a series of small, flat faces. Sometimes "
"this is a desirable effect, but usually we want our objects to look nice "
"and smooth."

"The easiest way is to set an entire object as smooth or faceted by "
"selecting a mesh object, and in *Object Mode*, click *Smooth* in the "
"*Tool Shelf*. This button does not stay pressed; it forces the assignment"
" of the \"smoothing\" attribute to each face in the mesh, including when "
"you add or delete geometry."

"Notice that the outline of the object is still strongly faceted. "
"Activating the smoothing features does not actually modify the object's "

"surfaces (normals will be interpolated), giving the illusion of a smooth "
"surface."
