msgid ""
"The Frame node is a useful tool for organizing nodes by collecting "
"related nodes together in a common area. Frames are useful when a node "
"setup becomes large and confusing yet the re-usability of a Node Group is"
" not required."

msgid ""
"Once a node is placed in the Frame, the Frame shrinks around it so as to "
"remove wasted space. At this point it is no longer possible to grab the "
"edge of the Frame to resize it, instead resizing occurs automatically "
"when nodes within the Frame are rearranged. This behavior can be changed "
"by disabling this option."

msgid ""
"When you need to display more comprehensive text, frame nodes can display"
" the contents of a text-block. This is read-only, so you will need to use"

"Once a Frame node is placed in the editor, nodes can be added by simply "

"To remove them select the node(s) and use the :kbd:`Alt-P` shortcut. This"
" uses the same default keyboard bindings as Parenting and can be thought "
"of as a similar concept."
