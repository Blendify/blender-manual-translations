"Clock: like the hands of an analog clock, it sweeps clockwise or (if Wipe In"

"Double Wipe: Starts in the middle and wipes outward, revealing the next "
"strip. It can also Wipe In, which means it starts at the outside and works "
"its way toward the middle. You can angle and blur the wipe direction as "
"well."

"The wipe will have no effect if created from a single strip instead of two "
"strips. The duration of the wipe is the intersection of the two source "
"strips and can not be adjusted. To adjust the start and end of the wipe you "
"must adjust the temporal bounds of the source strips in a way that alters "
"their intersection."
