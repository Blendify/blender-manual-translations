"The *Median Point* can be considered to be broadly similar to the concept of"
" Center of Gravity (COG). If we assume that every element (Object, face, "
"vertex etc) of the selection has the same mass, the median point would sit "
"at the point of equilibrium for the selection (the COG)."

"In Object Mode, Blender only considers the Object centers when determining "
"the median point. This can lead to some counterintuitive results. In the "
"Object Mode median points image below, you can see that the median point is "
"between the Object centers and can be nowhere near the Objects' mesh."

"In Edit Mode, the median point is determined via the part of the selection "
"that has the most elements. For example, in the *Median points in Edit Mode*"
" image, when there are two cubes with an equal number of vertices, the "
"median point lies directly between the two cubes. However, if we subdivide "
"one cube multiple times so that it has many more vertices, you can see that "
"the median point has shifted to the region with the most vertices."
