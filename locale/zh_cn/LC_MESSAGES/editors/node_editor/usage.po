"*Auto-offset* is a feature that helps organizing node layouts interactively "
"without interrupting the user workflow. When you drop a node with at least "
"one input and one output socket onto an existing connection between two "
"nodes, auto-offset will, depending on the direction setting, automatically "
"move the left or right node away to make room for the new node."
