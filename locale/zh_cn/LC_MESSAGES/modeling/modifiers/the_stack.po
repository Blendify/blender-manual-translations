"In a modifier stack the order in which modifiers are applied has an effect "
"on the result. Fortunately modifiers can be rearranged easily by clicking "
"the convenient up and down arrow icons. For example, the image below shows "
":doc:`SubSurf </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>` and :doc:`Mirror "
"</modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>` modifiers that have switched places."

"On the left, the *Mirror* modifier is the last item in the stack and the "
"result looks like two surfaces. On the right, the *Subsurf* modifier is the "
"last item in the stack and the result is a single merged surface."

"Modifiers are calculated from top to bottom in the stack. In this example, "
"the desired result (on right) is achieved by first mirroring the object, and"
" then calculating the subdivision surface."
