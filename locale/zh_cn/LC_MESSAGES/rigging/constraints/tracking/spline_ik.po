msgid ""
"The *Spline IK* constraint aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By "
"leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing "
"shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well-integrated control "
"offered by bones, *Spline IK* is an invaluable tool in the riggers' toolbox."
" It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts such as "
"tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as ropes."
