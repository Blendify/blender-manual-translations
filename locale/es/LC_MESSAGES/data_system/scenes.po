"Scene management and library appending/linking are based on Blender's "
":doc:`Library and Data System </data_system/index>`, so it is a good idea"
" to read that manual page first if you are not familiar with the basics "
"of that system."

msgid "Link Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/data_system/scenes.rst:41
msgid ""
"This option creates a new scene with the same settings and contents as "
"the active scene. However, instead of copying the objects, the new scene "
"contains links to the objects in the old scene. Therefore, changes to "
"objects in the new scene will result in the same changes to the original "
"scene, because the objects used are literally the same. The reverse is "
"also true."

msgid ""
"Creates new, duplicate copies of all of the objects in the currently "

"to the object-data (meshes, materials and so on) of the corresponding "
"objects in the original scene."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/data_system/scenes.rst:52
msgid ""
"This means that you can change the position, orientation and size of the "
"objects in the new scene without affecting other scenes, but any "
"modifications to the object-data (meshes, materials, etc.) will also "
"affect other scenes. This is because a single instance of the \"object-"
"data\" is now being shared by all of the objects in all of the scenes, "
"that link to it. This has the effect of making a new independent copy of "
"the object-data."

msgid ""
"Using this option, nothing is shared. This option creates a fully "
"independent scene with copies of the active scenes contents. Every object"
" in the original scene is duplicated, and a duplicate, private copy of "
"its object-data is made as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/data_system/scenes.rst:65
