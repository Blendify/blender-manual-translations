"Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate) various kinds of "
"data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-"
"file. For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be"
" put \"inside\" the blend-file via :menuselection:`File --> External Data"
" --> Pack into blend-file`. When the blend-file is saved, a copy of that "
"image file is put inside the blend-file. The blend-file can then be "
"copied or emailed anywhere, and the image texture moves with it."
