"Many blend-files reference external images or other linked blend-files. A"
" path tells Blender where to look for these files. If the external files "
"are moved, the blend-file that references them will not look right."

#: ../../manual/data_system/files/relative_paths.rst:10
msgid ""
"When you specify one of these external files, the default option is to "
"make the path relative. Blender stores a partial path evaluated relative "
"to the directory location of the referencing blend-file. This choice "
"helps when you need to reorganize folders or move your files."

msgid ""
"With a relative path, you can move the blend-file to a new location "
"provided the externally linked files are moved along with it. For "
"example, you could send someone a folder that contains a blend-file and a"
" sub-folder of external images that it references."

"When relative paths are supported, the File Browser provides a *Relative "
"Path* check box, when entering the path into a text field, use a double "
"slash prefix (``//``) to make it so."

"If it is necessary to relocate a blend-file relative to its linked "
"resources, use Blender's File :doc:`Save As </data_system/files/save>` "
"function which has an option to *Remap Relative* file links."
