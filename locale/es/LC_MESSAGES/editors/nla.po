"The NLA editor can manipulate and repurpose actions, without the tedium "
"of keyframe handling. Its often used to make broad, significant changes "
"to a scene's animation, with relative ease. It can also repurpose, and "
"\"layer\" actions, which make it easier to organize, and version-control "
"your animation."
