"Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when "
"each drawing, sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They "
"nicknamed this the 'dopesheet'. While CG foundations dramatically differ "
"from classical hand-drawn animation, Blender's Dopesheet inherits a "
"similar directive. It gives the animator a 'birds-eye-view' of every "
"thing occurring within a scene."

"\"stack\" of action channels - each one being shown as an horizontal "
"colored strip (of a darker shade \"during\" the animated/keyed period). "
"On these channel strips lay the keyframes, materialized as light-gray "
"(unselected) or yellow (selected) diamonds. One of the key feature of "
"this window is that it allow you to visualize immediately which channel "
"(i.e. Ipo curve) is *really* affected. When the value of a given channel "
"does not change at all between two neighboring keyframes, a gray "
"(unselected) or yellow (selected) line is drawn between them."
