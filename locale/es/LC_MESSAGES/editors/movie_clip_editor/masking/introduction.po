"Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow "
"to mask out, or influence a particular object in the footage. They can be"
" used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the "
"footage, or as a rough matte for green screen keying. Masks are "
"independent from a particular image of movie clip, and so they can just "
"as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the "
"compositor. These masks can also be used in other places in Blender."
