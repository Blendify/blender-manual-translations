"The *Transform Properties* section in the *View Properties* panel allows "

"mainly allows you to enter precise coordinates for a vertex, or median "
"position for a group of vertices (including an edge/face). As each type "
"of object has a different set of options in its *Transform Properties* "
"panel in *Edit Mode*, see their respective descriptions in the "
