"The *Transform Properties* section in the *View Properties* panel allows "
"you to view and manually/numerically control the position, rotation, and "
"other properties of an object, in *Object* mode. In *Edit* mode, it "
"mainly allows you to enter precise coordinates for a vertex, or median "
"position for a group of vertices (including an edge/face). As each type "
"of object has a different set of options in its *Transform Properties* "
"panel in *Edit* mode, see their respective descriptions in the "
":doc:`Modeling chapter </modeling/index>`."

"The locking feature of the Location, Rotation and Scale fields allows you"

" lock has been activated any other methods used for transformation are "
"blocked. For example, if you locked the *Location X* field then you can't"
" use the mouse to translate the object along the global X axis. However, "
"you can still translate it using the *Location X* edit field. Consider "
"the locking feature as a rigid constraint only changeable from the panel."
