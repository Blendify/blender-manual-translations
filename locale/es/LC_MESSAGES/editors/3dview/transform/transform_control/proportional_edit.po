"Proportional Edit is a way of transforming selected elements (such as "
"vertices) while having that transformation affect other nearby elements. "
"For example, having the movement of a single vertex cause the movement of"
" unselected vertices within a given range. Unselected vertices that are "
"closer to the selected vertex will move more than those farther from it "
"(i.e. they will move proportionally relative to the location of the "
"selected element). Since proportional editing affects the nearby "
"geometry, it is very useful when you need to smoothly deform the surface "
"of a dense mesh."
