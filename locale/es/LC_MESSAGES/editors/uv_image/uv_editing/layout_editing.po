"Another consideration is the need to conserve resources. Each image file "
"is loaded in memory. If you can re-use the same image on different "
"meshes, it saves memory. So, for example, you might want to have a "
"generic face painting, and use that on different characters, but alter "
"the UV map and shape and props (sunglasses) to differentiate."
