"Refinement comes into play when we finally look at our character, and "
"realize that we need more detail in a particular spot. For example, areas"
" around the eyes might need crow's feet, or we need to add a logo to the "
"vest. As you start to edit the image, you realize that there just aren't "
"enough pixels available to paint the detail that you want."

"Your only choice is to expand the size (scale out) that UV face. Using "
"the minimize stretch or scale commands, you expand the UV faces around "
"the eyes or chest, allocating more pixels to those areas, but at the same"
" time taking away pixels (detail) from something else, like the back of "
"the head. After refining the UV map, you then edit the image so that it "
"looks right and contains the details you want."

"Another consideration is the need to conserve resources. Each image file "
"is loaded in memory. If you can re-use the same image on different "
"meshes, it saves memory. So, for example, you might want to have a "
"generic 'face' painting, and use that on different characters, but alter "
"the UV map and shape and props (sunglasses) to differentiate."

"You might want to have a \"faded blue jeans\" texture, and unwrap just "
"the legs of characters to use that image. It would be good to have a "
"generic skin image, and use that for character's hands, feet, arms, legs,"
" and neck. When modeling a fantasy sword, a small image for a piece of "
"the sword blade would suffice, and you would Reset Unwrap the sword faces"
" to re-use that image down the length of the blade."
