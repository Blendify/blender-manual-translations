"This brush is similar to *Draw*, except that the height of the "

"The *Flatten* brush determines an \"area plane\" located by default at "

msgid ""
"Used to drag a group of points around. Unlike the other brushes, *Grab* "
"does not modify different points as the brush is dragged across the "
"model. Instead, *Grab* selects a group of vertices on mouse-down, and "
"pulls them to follow the mouse. The effect is similar to moving a group "
"of vertices in Edit Mode with proportional editing enabled, except that "
"*Grab* can make use of other Sculpt Mode options (like textures and "
"symmetry)."
