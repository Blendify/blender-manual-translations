"Are Bones which act in a similar way to switches, in that, they control "
"how other bones or objects react when they are transformed. A Control "
"Bone could for example act as a sliding switch control when the bone is "
"in one position to the left, it could indicate to other bones that they "
"react in a particular way when transformed, and when the Control Bone is "
"positioned to the right, transforming other bones or objects could do "
"something completely different. Control Bones are not directly used to "
"alter the positions of vertices; in fact, Control Bones often have no "
"vertices directly associated with themselves."
