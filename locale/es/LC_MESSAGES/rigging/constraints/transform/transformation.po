"This constraint is more complex and versatile than the other "
"\"transform\" constraints. It allows you to map one type of transform "
"properties (i.e. location, rotation or scale) of the target, to the same "
"or another type of transform properties of the owner, within a given "
"range of values (which might be different for each target and owner "
"property). You can also switch between axes, and use the range values not"
" as limits, but rather as \"markers\" to define a mapping between input "
"(target) and output (owner) values."

"rather \"markers\" defining a proportional (linear) mapping between input"

"(*The* *Extrapolate* *principles*). In these pictures, the input range "
"(in abscissa) is set to [``1.0, 4.0``], and its corresponding output "
