"The *Lennard Jones* force field is a very short range force with a "
"behavior determined by the sizes of the effector and effected particle. "
"At a distance smaller than the combined sizes the field is very repulsive"
" and after that distance it is attractive. It tries to keep the particles"
" at an equilibrium distance from each other. Particles need to be at a "
"close proximity to each other to be effected by this field at all."

"Particles can have for example both a charge and a Lennard-Jones "
