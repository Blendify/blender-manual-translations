"The physics constraints available in the non-game modes are meant to be "
"attached to an :term:`Empty` object. The constraint then has fields which"
" can be pointed at the two physics-enabled object which will be bound by "
"the constraint. The *Empty* object provides a location and axis for the "
"constraint distinct from the two constrained objects. The location of the"
" entity hosting the physics constraint marks a location and set of axes "
"on each of the two constrained objects. These two anchor points are "
"calculated at the beginning of the animation and their position and "
"orientation remain fixed in the *local* coordinate system of the object "
"for the duration of the animation. The objects can move far from the "
"constraint object, but the constraint anchor moves with the object. If "
"this feature seems limiting, consider using multiple objects with a non-"
"physics *Child-of* constraint and animate the relative location of the "
"child."

"The quickest way to constrain two objects is to select both and click the"
" *Connect* button in the *Physics* tab of the *Tool Shelf*. This creates "
"a new *Empty* object (named \"Constraint\") with a physics constraint "
"already attached and pointing at the two selected objects."

"Also you can create *Rigid Body Constaint* on of the two constrained "
"objects with *Rigid Body Constaint* button of the *Physics* context in "
"the *Properties* window. This constraint is dependent on the object "
"location and rotation on which it was created. This way, there are no "
"*Empty* object created for the constraint. The role of the *Empty* object"
" is put on this object. The constrained object can be then set as "
"*Passive* type for better driving the constrain."
