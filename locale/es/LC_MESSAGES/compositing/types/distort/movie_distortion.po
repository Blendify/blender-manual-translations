"In real life, all camera lenses produce some or the other sort of lens "
"distortion. But, whatever we render has got no distortion. So, this node "
"helps in removing distortion from movies or adding distortion to render "
"to make our render blend in with the movie clip. Usually, it is used "
"while motion tracking."

"Before using this node, one has to calculate the lens distortion of the "
"clip. This can be done by adjusting K1, K2 and K3 values in "

"For the first case, it is recommended to distort the render and leave the"
" movie clip as it is, because, undistorting the movie clip will require "
"extra pixel information, which is not available to blender. Similarly, in"
" the second case, it is recommended to undistort the movie clip and leave"
" the render as it is, becuase, distorting the render will require those "
"extra unavailable pixels. Doing the wrong method in the wrong case can "
"create weird results around the edges, such as in the image shown."
