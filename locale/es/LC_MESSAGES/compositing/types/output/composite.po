"The Composite node is where the actual output from the compositor is "
"connected to the renderer. Connecting a node to the *Composite* node will"
" output the result of that node's full tree to the Renderer; leaving this"
" node unconnected will result in a blank image. This node is updated "
"after each render, but also if you change things in your node-tree "
"(provided at least one finished input node is connected)."

msgid ""
"You can connect three channels: the actual RGBA image, the Alpha image, "
"and the Z (depth) image. You should only have one Composite node in your "
"map so that only one final image is rendered when the *Compositing* "
"button is pressed on the Render Options Post-Processing panel. Otherwise,"
" unpredictable results may occur."

"The RENDER button renders a single frame or image. Save your image using "
":kbd:`F3` or the *Fileâ†’Save Image* menu. The image will be saved using "
"the image format settings on the Render panel."

"To save a sequence of images, for example, if you input a movie clip or "
"used a Time node with each frame in its own file, use the *ANIM* button "
"and its settings. If you might want to later overlay them, be sure to use"
" an image format that supports an Alpha channel (such as PNG). If you "
"might want to later arrange them front to back or create a depth of field"
" effect, use a format that supports a Z-depth channel (such as EXR)."

"To save a composition as a movie clip (all frames in a single file), use "
