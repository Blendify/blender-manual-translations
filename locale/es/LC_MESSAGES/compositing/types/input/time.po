"The Time node generates a *fac* tor value (from 0.00 to 1.00) (that "
"changes according to the curve was drawn) as time progresses through your"
" movie (frames)."

"The *Start* and *End* NumButtons specify the range of time the values "
"should be output along, and this range becomes the X-axis of the graph. "
"The curve defines the Y-value and hence the factor that is output. In the"
" example to the right, since the time span is 250 frames and the line is "
"straight from corner to corner, 0.50 would be output at frame 125, and "
"0.75 will be output at frame 187."

"The :doc:`Map Value </compositing/types/vector/map_value>` node can be "
"used to map the output to a more appropriate value. With sometimes "
"curves, it is possible that the Time node may output a number larger than"
" one or less than zero. To be safe, use the Min/Max clamping function of "
"the Map Value node to limit output."

"You can reverse time (unfortunately, only in Blender and not in the real "
"world) by specifying a Start frame greater than the End frame. The net "
"effect of doing so is to flip the curve around. Warning: doing so is "
"easily overlooked in your node map and can be very confusing (like "
"meeting your mother when she was/is your age in \"Back to the Future\")."

"In Blender, time is measured in frames. The actual duration of a time "
"span depends on how fast those frames whiz by (frame rate). You set the "
"frame rate in your animation settings (:ref:`Render Dimensions Panel "
"<render_output-dimensions>`). Common settings range from 5 seconds per "
"frame for slideshows (0.2 fps), to 30 fps for US movies."

"Common uses for this include a :doc:`\"fade to black\" "
"</compositing/types/converter/set_alpha>`, wherein the accelerate time "
"curve (typically exponentially-shaped) feeds a mix value that mixes a "
"constant black color in, so that the blackness accelerates and eventually"
" darkens the image to total black. Other good uses include an increasing "
"soften (blur-out or -in) effect, or :doc:`fade-in "
"</compositing/types/converter/set_alpha>` a background or foreground, "
"instead of just jumping things into or out of the scene."

"You can even imagine hooking up one blur to a background render layer, "
"another inverted blur to a foreground render layer, and time feeding "
"both. This node group would simulate someone focusing the camera lens."

"As your imagination runs wild, consider a few ideas that came to me just "
"now on my couch: mixing a clouds texture with a time input to fog up a "
"piece of glass or show spray paint building up on a wall. Consider mixing"
" red and the soften with time (decreasing output) to show what someone "
"sees when waking up from a hard hit on the head. Mix HSV input with a "
"starfield image with time (decreasing output) to show what we might see "
"someday as we accelerate our starship and experience red-shift."
