"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender can be used to edit video. "
"There are two possible methods for this, one being the :doc:`Compositor </"
"compositing/introduction>`. However, this chapter describes the other, the "
"Video Sequence Editor (VSE), sometimes shortened to just \"Sequencer\". The "
"Sequencer within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you "
"to combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can use "
"these effects to create powerful video edits, especially when you combine "
"it with the animation power of Blender!"

"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or "
"in some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link the "
"end of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can add audio and "
"synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."
