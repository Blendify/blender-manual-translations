"For the effect to be efficient, samples needs to be coherent and not "
"random. This can lead to cross shaped pattern when the scattering radius "
"is high. Increasing the Jitter Threshold will rotate the samples below "
"this radius percentage in a random pattern in order to hide the visible "
"pattern. This affects performance if the scattering radius is large."
