"The size of the outer cone of a *Spot*, which largely controls the "

msgid ""
"The inner cone boundary line indicates the point at which light from the "
"*Spot* will start to blur/soften; before this point its light will mostly"
" be full strength. The larger the value of *Blend* the more blurred/soft "
"the edges of the spotlight will be, and the smaller the inner cone's "

msgid ""
"To make the *Spot* have a sharper falloff rate and therefore less "
"blurred/soft edges, decrease the value of *Blend*. Setting *Blend* to 0.0"

"light and shadow."

"The falloff rate of the *Spot* lamp light is a ratio between the *Blend* "
