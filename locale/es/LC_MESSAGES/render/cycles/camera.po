"A *Camera* is an object that provides a means of rendering images from "
"Blender. It defines which portion of a scene is visible in the rendered "
"image. By default a scene contains one camera. However, a scene can "
"contain more than one camera, but only one of them will be used at a "
"time. So you will only need to add a new camera if you are making cuts "
"between them. See :ref:`Animating Cameras <marker-bind-camera>`."
