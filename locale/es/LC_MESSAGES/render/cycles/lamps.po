"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission "
"shader, lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference"
" is that they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be "
"more easily managed as objects of their own type."

"For the branch path tracing integrator, this specifies the number of "

"By default lamps use only direct light sampling. For area lights and "

"Point lamps emit light equally in all directions. By setting the *Size* "

"Spot lamps emit light in a particular direction, inside a cone. By "
"setting the *Size* larger than zero, they can cast softer shadows and "
"shading. The size parameter defines the size of the cone, while the blend"

"Area lamps can also function as light portals to help sample the "
"environment light, and significantly reduce noise in interior scenes. "
"Note that rendering with portals is usually slower, but as it converges "
"more quickly, less samples are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:79

"Sun lamps emit light in a given direction. Their position is not taken "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:96
msgid ""
"Because they are not located inside the scene, their strength uses "

"lights."
