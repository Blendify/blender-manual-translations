"Dithering is a technique for blurring pixels to prevent banding that is "
"seen in areas of gradients, where stair-stepping appears between colors. "
"Banding artifacts are more noticeable when gradients are longer, or less "
"steep. Dithering was developed for graphics with low bit depths, meaning "
"they had a limited range of possible colors."

#: ../../manual/render/post_process/panel.rst:29
msgid ""
"Dithering works by taking pixel values and comparing them with a "
"threshold and neighboring pixels then does calculations to generate the "
"appropriate color. Dithering creates the perceived effect of a larger "
"color palette by creating a sort of visual color mixing. For example, if "
"you take a grid and distribute red and yellow pixels evenly across it, "
"the image would appear to be orange."
