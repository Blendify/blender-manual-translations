"Meta objects are *implicit surfaces*, meaning that they are *not* "
"*explicitly* defined by vertices (as meshes are) or control points (as "
"surfaces are): they exist *procedurally*. Meta objects are literally "
"mathematical formulas that are calculated on-the-fly by Blender."

"A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid "
"*mercurial*, or *clay-like* forms that have a \"rounded\" shape. "
"Furthermore, when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin "
"to interact with one another. They \"blend\" or \"merge\", as water "
"droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way, makes them very "
"handy for modeling streams of water when you don't want to do a fluid "
"simulation). If they subsequently move away from one another, they "
"restore their original shape."
