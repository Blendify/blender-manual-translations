"Splines are a substructure of curves and are the individual elements that"
" make curve objects. A curve object can be composed of several different "
"splines, just like mesh objects can have different discontinuous meshes "
"under the same object. A spline defines the shape of the curve and can be"
" transformed by altering its `Control Points`_. Splines come in three "
"distinct types, which are described in `Spline Types`_. Each spline type "
"has a slightly different algorithm for computing how bends in the spline "
"are represented."
