"Edge Loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "

"Take Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop` in organic modeling as an example: "
"the edge loops follow the natural contours and deformation lines of the "
"skin and the underlying muscles and are more dense in areas that deform "
"more when the character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees."
