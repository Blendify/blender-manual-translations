"A vertex is primarily a single point or position in 3D space. It is "
"usually invisible in rendering and in *Object Mode*. Do not mistake the "
"center point of an object for a vertex. It looks similar, but it's bigger"
" and you cannot select it. Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-vector` shows the "
"center point labeled as \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" are vertices."

"A simple way to create a new vertex is to click :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` in *Edit "
"Mode*. Of course, as a computer screen is two-dimensional, Blender cannot"
" determine all three vertex coordinates from a single mouse click, so the"
" new vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D cursor. Using the method "
"described above, any vertices selected previously are automatically "
"connected to the new ones by an edge. In the image above, the vertex "
"labeled \"C\" is a new vertex added to the cube with a new edge added "
"between in \"B\" and \"C\"."

"An edge always connects two vertices by a straight line. The edges are "
"the \"wires\" you see when you look at a mesh in wireframe view. They are"
" usually invisible on the rendered image. They are used to construct "
"faces. Create an edge by selecting two vertices and pressing :kbd:`F`."

"Faces are used to build the actual surface of the object. They are what "
"you see when you render the mesh. If this area does not contain a face, "
"it will simply be transparent or non-existent in the rendered image. To "
"create a face, select three or more suitable vertices and press :kbd:`F`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A face is defined as the area between either three (triangles), four "
"(quadrangles) or more (ngons) vertices, with an edge on every side. These"
" are often abbreviated to *tris, quads & ngons*."
msgstr ""

"Triangles are always flat and therefore easy to calculate. On the other "

"*Edge* and *Face Loops* are sets of faces or edges that form continuous "
"\"loops\" as shown in Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop`. The top row (1 - 4)"
" shows a solid view, the bottom row (5 - 8) a wireframe view of the same "
"loops."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:84
msgid ""
"Note that loops (2 and 4) do not go around the whole model. Loops stop at"
" so called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop from a"
" pole. Poles are vertices that are connected to either three, five, or "
"more edges. Accordingly, vertices connected to exactly one, two or four "
"edges are not poles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:90
msgid ""
"In the image above, loops that do not end in poles are cyclic (1 and 3). "
"They start and end at the same vertex and divide the model into two "
"partitions. Loops can be a quick and powerful tool to work with specific,"
" continuous regions of a mesh and are a prerequisite for organic "
"character animation. For a detailed description of how to work with loops"
" in Blender, see: :doc:`Advanced Selection "
"</modeling/meshes/selecting/advanced>`."

msgid "Edge Loops"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:103
msgid ""
"Loops (1 and 2) in Fig Edge and Face Loops are edge Loops. They connect "
"vertices so that each one on the loop has exactly two neighbors that are "
"not on the loop and placed on both sides of the loop (except the start "
"and end vertex in case of poles)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:107
msgid ""
"Edge Loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "
"modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to "
"build models with relatively few vertices that look very natural when "
"used as subdivision surfaces and deform very well in animation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:112
msgid ""
"Take Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-topo-loop` in organic modeling as an example: "
"the edge loops follow the natural contours and deformation lines of the "
"skin and the underlying muscles and are more dense in areas that deform "
"more when the character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees."

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:123

"These are a logical extension of Edge Loops in that they consist of the "
"faces between two Edge Loops, as shown in loops (3 and 4) in Fig. :ref"
":`fig-mesh-topo-loop`. Note that for non-circular loops (4) the faces "
"containing the poles are not included in a Face Loop."
