"The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, "
"Materials and Lights. In this part, the first of these is covered, that "
"being modeling. Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a "
"surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses "
"your imagination of abstract objects."
