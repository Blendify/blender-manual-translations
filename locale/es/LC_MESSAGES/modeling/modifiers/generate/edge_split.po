"The *Edge Split* modifier splits, duplicates edges within a mesh, "
"breaking 'links' between faces around those split edges."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/edge_split.rst:10
msgid ""
"The edges to split can be determined from the edge angle (i.e. angle "
"between faces forming that edge), and/or edges marked as sharp."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/generate/edge_split.rst:13
msgid ""
"Splitting an edge affects vertex normal generation at that edge, making "
"the edge appear sharp. Hence, this modifier can be used to achieve the "
"same effect as :ref:`Auto Smooth <auto-smooth>`, making edges appear "
"sharp when their angle is above a certain threshold. It can also be used "
"for manual control of the smoothing process, where the user defines which"
" edges should appear smooth or sharp (see :ref:`Mesh Smoothing <modeling-"
"meshes-editing-normals-shading>` for other ways to do this). If desired, "
"both modes can be active at once."
