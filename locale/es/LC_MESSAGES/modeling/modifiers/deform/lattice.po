"The Lattice modifier deforms the base object according to the shape of a "
":doc:`Lattice </rigging/lattice>` object. Objects to be deformed can be "
"meshes, curves, surfaces, text, lattices and even particles."

"A Lattice Modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by selecting "
"them all, then selecting the lattice object last and pressing "
":kbd:`Ctrl-P` and choosing *Lattice Deform*. This will both add Lattice "
"Modifiers to the selected objects and parent them to the lattice."

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:36
msgid ""
"Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the "
"mesh itself in Edit Mode ? There are a couple of reasons for that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:39
msgid ""
"If your object has a large number of vertices, it would be difficult to "
"edit portions of it quickly in Edit Mode. Using a lattice will allow you "
"to deform large portions efficiently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:41
msgid ""
"The smooth deformation you get from a Lattice Modifier can be hard to "
"achieve manually in Edit Mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:42
msgid ""
"Multiple objects can use the same lattice, thus allowing you to edit "
"multiple objects at once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:43
msgid ""
"Like all modifiers, it is non-destructive. Meaning all changes happen on "
"top of the original geometry, which you can still go back and edit "
"without affecting the deformation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:45
msgid "A lattice does not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface."

"When using a lattice to deform particles, always remember to place the "
"Lattice Modifier after the Particle System Modifier. Read more about the "
"importance of the modifier stack :ref:`Here <modifier-stack>`."
