msgid ""
"The *Explode* modifier is used to alter the mesh geometry by "
"moving/rotating its faces in a way that roughly tracks particles emitted "
"by that object, making it look as if the mesh is being exploded (broken "
"apart and pushed outward)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:11
msgid ""
"For this modifier to have any visible effect, there needs to be a "
"particle system on its object. That particle system will control how the "
"mesh is exploded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/simulate/explode.rst:14
msgid ""
"Both the number of emitted particles and number of faces determine how "
"granular the *Explode* modifier is. More faces and more particles will "
"mean more individual pieces."
