"Once an armature is :doc:`skinned </rigging/armatures/skinning/index>` by"

"positions known as poses. Basically, by transforming the bones, you "
"deform or transform the skinned object(s). However, you will notice that "
"you cannot do this in *Edit Mode* -- remember that *Edit Mode* is used to"
" edit the default, base, or \"rest\" position of an armature. You may "

"So, armatures have a third mode dedicated to the process of posing known "
"as *Pose Mode*. In rest position (as edited in *Edit Mode*), each bone "
"has its own position/rotation/scale to neutral values (i.e. 0.0 for "
"position and rotation, and 1.0 for scale). Hence, when you edit a bone in"
" *Pose Mode*, you create an offset in the transform properties, from its "
"rest position. This may seem quite similar if you have worked with "
":doc:`relative shape keys </animation/shape_keys/index>` or :ref:`Delta "
"Transformations <transform-delta>`."

"read the :doc:`animation chapter </animation/index>` first, and then come"
