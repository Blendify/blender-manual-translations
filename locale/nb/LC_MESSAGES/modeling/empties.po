"The \"Empty\" is a single coordinate point with no additional geometry. "
"Because an Empty has no volume and surface, it cannot be rendered. Still "
"it can be used as a handle for many purposes."

msgid ""
"While Empties don't exactly have any object data attached to them which "
"can be used for supporting \"true\" apply scale (i.e. with non-uniform "
"scaling), they do have a draw size value which controls how large the "
"empties are drawn (before scaling). This works by taking the scale factor"
" on the most-scaled axis, and combines this with the existing empty draw "
"size to maintain the correct dimensions on that axis."
