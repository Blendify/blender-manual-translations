"While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out "
"from a light object is considered as indirect lighting in Eevee. That "
"means distant :term:`HDRI` lighting (or World) is considered as indirect "

"In Eevee, indirect lighting is separated into two component: Diffuse and "
