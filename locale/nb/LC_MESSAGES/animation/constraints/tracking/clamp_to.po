"The *Clamp To* constraint clamps an object to a curve. The *Clamp To* "
"constraint is very similar to the :doc:`Follow Path "
"</animation/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` constraint, but "
"instead of using the evaluation time of the target curve, *Clamp To* will"
" get the actual location properties of its owner (those shown in the "
"*Transform* panel), and judge where to put it by \"mapping\" this "
"location along the target curve."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:14
msgid ""
"One benefit is that when you are working with *Clamp To*, it is easier to"
" see what your owner will be doing; since you are working in the 3D View,"
" it will just be a lot more precise than sliding keys around on an "
"F-Curve and playing the animation over and over."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:19
msgid ""
"A downside is that unlike in the :doc:`Follow Path constraint "
"</animation/constraints/relationship/follow_path>`, *Clamp To* does not "
"have any option to track your owner's rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) to the "
"banking of the targeted curve, but you do not always need rotation on, so"
" in cases like this it's usually a lot handier to fire up a *Clamp To*, "
"and get the bits of rotation you do need some other way."

"The mapping from the object's original position to its position on the "
"curve is not perfect, but uses the following simplified algorithm:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:30
msgid ""
"A \"main axis\" is chosen, either by the user, or as the longest axis of "
"the curve's bounding box (the default)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:31
msgid ""
"The position of the object is compared to the bounding box of the curve "
"in the direction of the main axis. So for example if X is the main axis, "
"and the object is aligned with the curve bounding box's left side, the "
"result is 0; if it is aligned with the right side, the result is 1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:34
msgid "If the cyclic option is unchecked, this value is clamped in the range 0-1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:35
msgid ""
"This number is used as the curve time, to find the final position along "
"the curve that the object is clamped to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:37
msgid ""
"This algorithm does not produce exactly the desired result because curve "
"time does not map exactly to the main axis position. For example an "
"object directly in the center of a curve will be clamped to a curve time "
"of 0.5 regardless of the shape of the curve, because it is halfway along "
"the curve's bounding box. However, the 0.5 curve time position can "
"actually be anywhere within the bounding box!"

"The Target: field indicates which curve object the Clamp To constraint "
"will track along. The Target: field must be a curve object type. If this "
":ref:`ui-data-id` field is not filled in then it will be highlighted in "
"red indicating that this constraint does not have all the information it "
"needs to carry out its task and will therefore be ignored on the "
"constraint stack."

"This button group controls which global axis (X, Y or Z) is the main "
"direction of the path. When clamping the object to the target curve, it "
"will not be moved significantly on this axis. It may move a small amount "
"on that axis because of the inexact way this constraint functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:61
msgid ""
"For example if you are animating a rocket launch, it will be the Z axis "
"because the main direction of the launch path is up. The default *Auto* "
"option chooses the axis which the curve is longest in (or X if they are "
"equal). This is usually the best option."

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:66
msgid ""
"By default, once the object has reached one end of its target curve, it "
"will be constrained there. When the *Cyclic* option is enabled, as soon "
"as it reaches one end of the curve, it is instantaneously moved to its "
"other end. This is of course primarily designed for closed curves "
"(circles & co), as this allows your owner to go around it over and over."
