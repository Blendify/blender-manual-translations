"Blender has the ability to encapsulate (incorporate) various kinds of "
"data within the blend-file that is normally saved outside of the blend-"
"file. For example, an image texture that is an external image file can be"
" put \"inside\" the blend-file. This allows to share a full project as a "
"single file, instead of e.g. an archive containing the blend-file and all"
" of its dependencies."
