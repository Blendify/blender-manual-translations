"The Subdivision Surface Modifier is used to split the faces of a mesh "
"into smaller faces giving a smooth appearance. Using this modifier, "
"enables you to model complex smooth surfaces with simple, low-vertex "
"meshes. This allows modeling of high resolution meshes without the need "
"to save and maintain huge amounts of data and it gives a smooth *organic*"
" look to the object."
