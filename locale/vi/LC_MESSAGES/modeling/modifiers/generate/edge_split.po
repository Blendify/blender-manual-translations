msgid "Splitting an edge affects vertex normal generation at that edge, making the edge appear sharp. Hence, this modifier can be used to achieve the same effect as :ref:`Auto Smooth <auto-smooth>`, making edges appear sharp when their angle is above a certain threshold. It can also be used for manual control of the smoothing process, where the user defines which edges should appear smooth or sharp (see :ref:`Mesh Smoothing <modeling-meshes-editing-normals-shading>` for other ways to do this). If desired, both modes can be active at once."
