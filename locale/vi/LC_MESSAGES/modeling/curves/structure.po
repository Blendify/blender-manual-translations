"N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. One of "
"the major differences between Bézier objects and NURBS objects is that "
"Bézier curves are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an "
"*approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* circle."
" NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an introduction, "
"please consult the `Wikipedia page "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__."
