"Blender uses a \"Font System\" to manage mapping letter codes to objects "
"representing them in 3D views. This font system has its own *built-in* "
"font, but it can use external fonts too, including *PostScript Type 1*, "
"*OpenType* and *TrueType* fonts. And moreover, it can use any objects "
"existing in the current blend-file as letters."

"*Text* objects allow you to create and render 2D or 3D text, with various"
" advanced layout options, like justifying and frames. By default, letters"
" are just flat filled surfaces, exactly like any closed 2D curve. But, "
"just like *Curves*, you can extrude them. And texts can follow other "
"curves."

"A maximum of 50000 characters is allowed per text object; however, be "
"forewarned that the more characters a single text object has, the slower "
"the object will respond interactively."

"When you switch between *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode*, the *Font* panel "
"remains the same. This means that its settings can be applied equally in "
"both modes, and this implies that you cannot apply them to just a part of"
" the text. So font, size, and so on, are common to all letters in a "
"*Text* object. There is just one exception: the *Bold* or *Italic* "
"buttons control properties specific to each letter (this is a way to use "
"up to four different fonts in a text)."
