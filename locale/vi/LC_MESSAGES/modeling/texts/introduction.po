"Blender uses a \"Font System\" to manage mapping letter codes to objects "
"representing them in 3D views. This font system has its own *built-in* "
"font, but it can use external fonts too, including *PostScript Type 1*, "
"*OpenType* and *TrueType* fonts. And moreover, it can use any objects "
"existing in the current blend-file as letters."

"*Text* objects allow you to create and render 2D or 3D text, with various"
" advanced layout options, like justifying and frames. By default, letters"
" are just flat filled surfaces, exactly like any closed 2D curve. But, "
"just like *Curves*, you can extrude them. And texts can follow other "
"curves."
