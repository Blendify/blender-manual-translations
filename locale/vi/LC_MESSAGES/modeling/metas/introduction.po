"A very distinct visual characteristic of metas is that they are fluid "
"*mercurial*, or *clay-like* forms that have a \"rounded\" shape. "
"Furthermore, when two meta objects get close to one another, they begin "
"to interact with one another. They \"blend\" or \"merge\", as water "
"droplets do, especially in zero-g (which, by the way, makes them very "
"handy for modeling streams of water when you do not want to do a fluid "
"simulation). If they subsequently move away from one another, they "
"restore their original shape."

"Typically *Meta* objects are used for special effects or as a basis for "
