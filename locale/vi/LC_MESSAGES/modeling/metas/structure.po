"A more formal definition of a meta object can be given as a *directing "
"structure* which can be seen as the source of a static field. The field "
"can be either positive or negative and hence the field generated by "
"neighboring directing structures can attract or repel."

msgid ""
"The implicit surface is defined as the surface where the 3D field "
"generated by all the directing structures assume a given value. For "
"example a meta ball, whose directing structure is a point, generates an "
"isotropic (i.e. identical in all directions) field around it and the "
"surfaces at constant field value are spheres centered at the directing "
"point."

"*Meta* objects are nothing more than mathematical formula that perform "
"logical operations on one another (AND, OR), and that can be added and "
"subtracted from each other. This method is also called *Constructive "
"Solid Geometry* (CSG). Because of its mathematical nature, CSG uses "
"little memory, but requires lots of processing power to compute."
