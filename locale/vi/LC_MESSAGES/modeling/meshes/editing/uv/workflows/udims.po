"Using UV maps can have one disadvantage, they consist of one texture for "
"the entire mesh. Most of the time this is sufficient but the disadvantage"
" is that the texture is one resolution for the entire mesh. This causes "
"issues if you have a very large mesh with geometry of different "
"importance. When using a singular texture, it might have not enough "
"resolution to cover larger UV islands while being efficient for smaller, "
"less important islands."

"UDIM offers a solution to this by being able to spread UV islands across "
"several different textures. UDIM which stands for U DIMension is based on"
" a tile system where each tile is a different texture in the overall UDIM"
" texture array. Basically each tile consists of its own UV space (0-1, "
"1-2, 2-3) and have its own image assigned to that tile. Tiles are managed"
" in the `UDIM Tiles`_ panel where they can have a generated image "
"assigned to them. Generally, you create several textures of different "
"resolutions; for example, you may have a 4k resolution texture for the "
"major details, and 2k and/or 1k textures for less important details."

"The UDIM array consists of one main tile, this tile is given the index "
"number of ``1001``. The next tile that gets added will be ``1002`` and "
"will be placed to the right of the main tile. The overall UDIM array is "
"ten tiles wide, so tiles ``1001`` through ``1010`` are created on the "
"first row. After ten tiles a new row of tiles is started above the main "
"tile; so ``1011`` will be place directly above ``1001``."

"To start using a UDIM workflow, you should unwrap a mesh as you would for"
" any other UV map. After that you should decide how many textures you "
"want to split your UV map into. This will be different for every mesh and"
" workflow but a good minimum is 3: one 4k, one 2k, and one 1k image. Then"
" create the desired textures to match how many textures you want."
