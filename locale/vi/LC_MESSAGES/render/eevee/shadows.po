msgid "They are fast to filter but suffer form light leaking near the occluder. This can be minimized by increasing the *Exponent* parameter. Another issue is the artifacts present at depth discontinuity. Unfortunately, there is no workaround for this issue and the only way to minimize it is to reduce the *Soft* parameter."

msgid "Filters nicely and gives smooth shadow map appearance across the whole shadow range. However it suffers from visible grainy artifacts when using low bit depth. It is also prone to light leaking when two occluders overlap. In this case the shadows can be overdarkened to reduce the leak, by using the *Bleed Bias* parameter. VSM uses twice as much memory as ESM, and are slower."
