msgid "While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out from a lamp object is considered as indirect lighting in Eevee. That means distant HDRI lighting (or World) is considered as indirect lighting. Mesh objects using an Emission node are also considered as indirect lighting."

msgid "In Eevee, indirect lighting is separated into two component: Diffuse and Specular. Both have different needs and representation. For efficiency, the indirect lighting data is precomputed on demand into a static lighting cache."
