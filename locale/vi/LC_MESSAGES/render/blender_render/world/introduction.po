"The world buttons let you set up the shading of your scene in general. It"
" can provide ambient color, and special effects such as mist, but a very "
"common use of a *World* is to shade a background color. These are "
"accessible via the *World* tab."

"While these world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a "
"scene, :doc:`compositing nodes </compositing/index>` are often preferred,"
" though more complex to master, for the additional control and options "
"they offer. For example, filtering the Z value (distance from camera) or "
"normals (direction of surfaces) through compositing nodes can further "
"increase the depth and spatial clarity of a scene."
