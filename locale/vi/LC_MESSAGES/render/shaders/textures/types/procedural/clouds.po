msgid "Clouds represent Perlin noise. In addition, each noise-based Blender texture (with the exception of Voronoi and simple noise) has a *Noise Basis* setting that allows the user to select which algorithm is used to generate the texture. This is often used for Clouds, Fire, Smoke. Well-suited to be used as a Bump map, giving an overall irregularity to the material."
