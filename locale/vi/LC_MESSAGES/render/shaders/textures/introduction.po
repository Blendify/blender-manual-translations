"In CGI, texture mapping is a method to add detail to surfaces by "
"projecting images and patterns onto those surfaces. The projected images "
"and patterns can be set to affect not only color, but also specularity, "
"reflection, transparency, and even fake three-dimensional depth. Most "
"often, the images and patterns are projected during render time, but "
"texture mapping is also used to sculpt, paint and deform objects."

"This notion of using *more than one* texture, to achieve a combined "
"effect, is one of the \"hidden secrets\" of creating realistic-looking "
"objects. If you carefully \"look at the light\" while examining any real-"
"world object, you will observe that the final appearance of that object "
"is best described as the combination, in different ways and in different "
"amounts, of several distinct underlying visual characteristics. These "
"characteristics might be more (or less) strongly apparent at different "
"angles, under different lighting conditions, and so forth. Blender allows"
" you to achieve this in many ways."

"A Material Texture, that has a Map Input of UV, and is an image texture "
"that is mapped to Color, is equivalent to a UV texture. It provides much "
"more flexibility, because it can be sized and offset, and the degree to "
"which it affects the color of your object can be controlled in the Map To"
" panel. In addition, you can have different images for each texture "
"channel; one for color, one for alpha, one for normals, one for "
"specularity, one for reflectivity, *etc.* Procedural textures, like "
"Clouds, are incredibly simple and useful for adding realism and details "
