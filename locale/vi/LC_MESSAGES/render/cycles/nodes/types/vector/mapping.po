msgid "The *Mapping Node* is used to transform an image or procedural texture. For example, you can use it to move, rotate, or scale textures. If you have ever done any UV editing in the past, then you will likely know that these can also be accomplished by modifying an object's UVs in the :doc:`UV/Image editor </editors/uv_image/uv/index>`. However, it is sometimes useful to have easy access to these functions through nodes rather than having to modify the UVs. One example of this might be when you have several textures, each of which needs to be transformed individually e.g. decals on an object."
