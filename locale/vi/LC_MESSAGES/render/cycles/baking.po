"Baking, in general, is the act of pre-computing something in order to "
"speed up some other process later down the line. Rendering from scratch "
"takes a lot of time depending on the options you choose. Therefore, "
"Blender allows you to \"bake\" some parts of the render ahead of time, "
"for select objects. Then, when you press Render, the entire scene is "
"rendered much faster, since the colors of those objects do not have to be"
" recomputed."

"Render baking creates 2D bitmap images of a mesh object's rendered "
"surface. These images can be re-mapped onto the object using the object's"
" UV coordinates. Baking is done for each individual mesh, and can only be"
" done if that mesh has been UV-unwrapped. While it takes time to set up "
"and perform, it saves render time. If you are rendering a long animation,"
" the time spent baking can be much less than time spent rendering out "
"each frame of a long animation."

"Use *Full Render* or *Textures* to create an image texture; baked "
"procedural textures can be used as a starting point for further texture "
"painting. Use *Normals* to make a low resolution mesh look like a high "
"resolution mesh. To do that, UV unwrap a high resolution, finely sculpted"
" mesh and bake its normals. Save that normal map, and *Mapping* (texture "
"settings) the UV of a similarly unwrapped low resolution mesh. The low "
"resolution mesh will look just like the high resolution, but will have "
"much fewer faces/polygons."

"The baking happens into the respective active textures of the object "
"materials. The active texture is the last selected Image Texture node of "
"the material node tree. That means the active object (or the selected "
"objects, when not baking 'Selected to Active') needs a material, and that"
" material needs at least an Image Texture node, with the image to be used"
" for the baking. Note, the node does not need to be connected to any "
"other node. The active texture is what projection painting and the "
"viewport use as a criteria to which image to use. This way after the "
"baking is done you can automatically preview the baked result in the "
"Texture mode."
