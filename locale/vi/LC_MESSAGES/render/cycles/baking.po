msgid "Baking, in general, is the act of pre-computing something in order to speed up some other process later down the line. Rendering from scratch takes a lot of time depending on the options you choose. Therefore, Blender allows you to \"bake\" some parts of the render ahead of time, for select objects. Then, when you press Render, the entire scene is rendered much faster, since the colors of those objects do not have to be recomputed."

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/baking.rst:19
msgid "Render baking creates 2D bitmap images of a mesh object's rendered surface. These images can be re-mapped onto the object using the object's UV coordinates. Baking is done for each individual mesh, and can only be done if that mesh has been UV-unwrapped. While it takes time to set up and perform, it saves render time. If you are rendering a long animation, the time spent baking can be much less than time spent rendering out each frame of a long animation."

msgid "Use *Full Render* or *Textures* to create an image texture; baked procedural textures can be used as a starting point for further texture painting. Use *Normals* to make a low resolution mesh look like a high resolution mesh. To do that, UV unwrap a high resolution, finely sculpted mesh and bake its normals. Save that normal map, and *Mapping* (texture settings) the UV of a similarly unwrapped low resolution mesh. The low resolution mesh will look just like the high resolution, but will have much fewer faces/polygons."

msgid "The baking happens into the respective active textures of the object materials. The active texture is the last selected Image Texture node of the material node tree. That means the active object (or the selected objects, when not baking 'Selected to Active') needs a material, and that material needs at least an Image Texture node, with the image to be used for the baking. Note, the node does not need to be connected to any other node. The active texture is what projection painting and the viewport use as a criteria to which image to use. This way after the baking is done you can automatically preview the baked result in the Texture mode."
