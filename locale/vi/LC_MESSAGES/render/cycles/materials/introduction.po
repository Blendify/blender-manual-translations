"A material defines the artistic qualities of the substance that an object"
" is made of. In its simplest form, you can use materials to show the "
"substance an object is made of, or to \"paint\" the object with different"
" colors. Usually, the substance is represented by its surface qualities "
"(color, shininess, reflectance, etc.) but it can also exhibit more "
"complicated effects such as transparency, diffraction and subsurface "
"scattering. Typical materials might be brass, skin, glass, or linen."

"The rendered image you create with Blender is a projection of the scene "
"onto an imaginary surface called the *viewing plane*. The viewing plane "
"is analogous to the film in a traditional camera, or the rods and cones "
"in the human eye, except that it receives simulated light, not real "
"light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To render an image of a scene we must first determine what light from the"
" scene is arriving at each point on the viewing plane. The best way to "
"answer this question is to follow a straight line (the simulated light "
"ray) backwards through that point on the viewing plane and the focal "
"point (the location of the camera) until it hits a renderable surface in "
"the scene, at which point we can determine what light would strike that "

"Two basic types of phenomena take place at any point on a surface when a "

"The exact effect of Material settings can be affected by a number of "

"Blender Renderer (aka Blender Internal or BI) require quite different "
"illumination levels to achieve similar results, and even then the "
"appearance of objects can be quite different. Also, the material "
"properties settings can be affected by the texture method used (single-"
"texture, multi-texture or GLSL). So it is recommended to always select "
"the appropriate system settings before starting the design of materials."
