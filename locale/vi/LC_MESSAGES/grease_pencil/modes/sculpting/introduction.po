"*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the "
"shape of a drawing, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: "
"Instead of dealing with individual elements (points and edit lines), an "
"area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of "
"selecting a group of points, Sculpt Mode manipulates the drawing in the "
"brush region of influence."
