"Weight Painting is a method to maintain large amounts of weight "
"information in a very intuitive way. The selected *Grease Pencil* Object "
"is displayed slightly shaded with a rainbow color spectrum. The color "
"visualizes the weights associated to each point in the active Vertex "
"Group. By default blue means unweighted and red means fully weighted."

"You assign weights to the points of the Object by painting on it with "
