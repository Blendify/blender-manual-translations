"The Add Effect adds the colors of two strips together. Use this effect "
"with a base image strip, and a modifier strip. The modifier strip is "
"either a solid color or a black-and-white mask, or another image "
"entirely."

"You can use this effect to increase the brightness of an image, or if you"
" use a BW mask, selectively increase the brightness of certain areas of "
"the image. The Mix node, in Add mode, does exactly the same thing as the "
"Add SFX strip here, and is controlled the same way by feeding the Factor "
"input."

"The example shows what happens when you add gray to an image. The image "
"gets bright because we are adding gray (R:0.5, G:0.5, B:0.5) to say, a "
"blue color (R:0.1, G:0.1, B:0.5) resulting in (R:0.6, G:0.6, B:1.0) which"
" retains the original hue (relationship between the colors) but is much "
"brighter (has a higher value). When applied to the whole image like this,"
" it seems to flash."
