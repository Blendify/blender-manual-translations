"Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic "
"distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-"
"independent set of baked geometric results. This 'distillation' of scenes"
" into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting"
" and rendering scenes into rendered image data."

"Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex"
" procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically **not** "
"concerned with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools "
"used to create the computed results. For example, Alembic will "
"efficiently store the animated vertex positions and animated transforms "
"that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process "
"which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving "
"simulations, cloth and flesh simulations, and so on. Alembic will not "
"attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, "
"basically) which are required to produce the final, animated vertex "
"positions and animated transforms."
