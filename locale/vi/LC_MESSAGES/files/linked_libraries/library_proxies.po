"Proxies are the historical way in Blender to allow some local editing of "
"linked data-blocks. This is mostly aimed at character animation."

"One of their most important restrictions is that you can only have one "
"proxy of any linked object in a given blend-file."

"This makes the active linked object into a local proxy, appending "
"\"_proxy\" to its name. It allows you to make changes locally over an "
"object (or collection) linked from an external library."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/files/linked_libraries/library_proxies.rst:32
msgid ""
"Possible changes are restricted, you can mainly edit and animate "
"transformations of the proxy object, and its constraints. Those changes "
"remain local, they are not sent back to the external library."

msgid ""
"Another way to transform a linked object locally is with the use of "
":doc:`Collection Instancing "
"</scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/collection>`. Instead of "
"linking objects directly, it is often more useful to link in "
"*collections*, which can be assigned to empties and moved, while "
"maintaining the link to the original file."

"It is also useful to be able to add/remove objects from the collection "
"(from within the library blend-file) without having to manage re-linking "
"of multiple objects."

"It is also possible, in the source (library) blend-file, to protect some "
"bone layers from being editable in proxies. This helps keeping complex "
"rigs usage sensible, by only exposing some 'public' bone layers as "
"editable by users."
