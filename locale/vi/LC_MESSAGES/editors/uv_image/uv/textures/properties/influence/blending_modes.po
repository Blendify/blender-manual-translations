msgid "Blending Modes are different methods of controlling how the texture influences material properties. While a blending mode defines the specific operation performed, blending factor controls the amount, the overall \"strength\" of this operation. For textures such blending factor is set via sliders in the Influence panel."

The *Stencil* mode works similar to a layer mask in a 2D program. The effect of a stencil texture cannot be overridden, only extended. You need an intensity map as input."

msgid "If you want transparent material, and use a texture mapped to *Alpha*, nothing happens with the default settings, because the *Alpha* value in the *Material* panel is 1. So you have to set *DVar* to 0 to get transparent material (and of course *Z Transparency* also). This is a common problem for beginners. Or do it the other way round: set *Alpha* to 0 and leave *Dvar* on 1. Of course the texture is used inverted then."
