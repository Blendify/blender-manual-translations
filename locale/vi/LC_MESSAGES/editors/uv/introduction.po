"The most flexible way of mapping a 2D texture over a 3D object is a "
"process called \"UV mapping\". In this process, you take your three-"
"dimensional (X, Y & Z) mesh and unwrap it to a flat two-dimensional (X & "
"Y ... or rather, as we shall soon see, \"U & V\") image. Colors in the "
"image are thus mapped to your mesh, and show up as the color of the faces"
" of the mesh. Use UV texturing to provide realism to your objects that "
"procedural materials and textures cannot do, and better details than "
"Vertex Painting can provide."

"If you were to take a pair of scissors and cut a seam or fold of the box,"
" you would be able to lay it flat on a tabletop. As you are looking down "
"at the box on the table, we could say that U is the left-right direction,"
" and V is the up-down direction. This image is thus in two dimensions "
"(2D). We use U and V to refer to these \"texture-space coordinates\" "
"instead of the normal X and Y, which are always used (along with Z) to "
"refer to the three-dimensional space (3D)."

"When the box is reassembled, a certain UV location on the paper is "

"During the UV unwrapping process, you tell Blender exactly how to map the"
" faces of your object (in this case, a box) to a flat image in the UV "
"Editor. You have complete freedom in how to do this. (Continuing our "
"previous example, imagine that, having initially laid the box flat on the"
" tabletop, you now cut it into smaller pieces, somehow stretch and/or "
"shrink those pieces, and then arrange them in some way upon a photograph "
"that is also lying on that tabletop.)"

"In this image you can easily see that the shape and size of the marked "
"face in 3D space is different in UV space. This difference is caused by "
"the \"stretching\" (technically called mapping) of the 3D part (XYZ) onto"
" a 2D plane (i.e. the UV map)."

"If a 3D object has a UV map, then, in addition to the 3D coordinates X, "

msgid ""
"On more complex models (like seen in the sphere above) there pops up an "
"issue where the faces cannot be cut, but instead they are stretched in "
"order to make them flat. This helps making easier UV maps, but sometimes "
"adds distortion to the final mapped texture."

"While procedural textures (described in the previous chapters) are useful"
" -- they never repeat themselves and always \"fit\" 3D objects -- they "
"are not sufficient for more complex or natural objects. For instance, the"
" skin on a human head will never look quite right when procedurally "
"generated. Wrinkles on a human head, or scratches on a car do not occur "
"in random places, but depend on the shape of the model and its usage. "
"Manually-painted images, or images captured from the real world gives "
"more control and realism. For details such as book covers, tapestry, "
"rugs, stains, and detailed props, artists are able to control every pixel"
" on the surface using a UV texture."

"A UV map describes what part of the texture should be attached to each "
"polygon in the model. Each polygon's vertex gets assigned to 2D "
"coordinates that define which part of the image gets mapped. These 2D "
"coordinates are called UVs (compare this to the XYZ coordinates in 3D). "
"The operation of generating these UV maps is also called \"unwrap\", "
"since it is as if the mesh were unfolded onto a 2D plane."

"For most simple 3D models, Blender has an automatic set of unwrapping "

" Cubic, Cylindrical or Spherical mapping, is usually not sufficient. For "
"even and accurate projection, use seams to guide the UV mapping. This can"
" be used to apply textures to arbitrary and complex shapes, like human "
"heads or animals. Often these textures are painted images, created in "
"applications like the Gimp, Krita, or your favorite painting application."
