msgid "The *Region/Volume clipping* image shows an example of using the clipping tool with a cube. Start by activating the tool with :kbd:`Alt-B` (upper left of the image). This will generate a dashed cross-hair cursor. Click with the :kbd:`LMB` and drag out a rectangular region shown in the upper right. Now a region is defined and clipping is applied against that region in 3D space. Notice that part of the cube is now invisible or clipped. Use the :kbd:`MMB` to rotate the view and you will see that only what is inside the pyramidal volume is visible. All the editing tools still function as normal but only within the pyramidal clipping volume."

msgid "When using :ref:`rendered shading <view3d-viewport-shading>` mode, it can be quite slow to render the entire 3D View. To fix this, you can define a subregion to render just a portion of the viewport instead of the entire viewport. This can be very useful for reducing render times for quick previews on an area of interest."
