msgid "The *Multiply* effect multiplies two colors. Blender uses values between (0.0 to 1.0) for the colors. This operation does not have to be normalized, the multiplication of two terms between (0.0 to 1.0) always gives a result between (0.0 to 1.0)."

msgid "(with the \"traditional\" representation of three bytes, like RGB(124, 255, 56), the multiplications give far too high results, like RGB(7316, 46410, 1848), that have to be normalized (brought back) by dividing them by 256 to fit in the range of (0 to 255)...)."

msgid "For example, if you have a brown pixel RGB(0.50, 0.29, 0.05), and you multiply it with a cyan filter (uniform color RGB(0.0, 1.0, 1.0)), you will get a color RGB(0.0, 0.29, 0.5). Visually, the result is to zero the reds and bring up (by \"symmetry\" -- the real values remain unchanged!) the blues and greens. Physically, it is the same effect as shining a cyan light onto a chocolate bar. Emotionally, vegetation becomes more lush, water becomes more Caribbean and inviting, skies become friendlier."
