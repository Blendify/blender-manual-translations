"existing real-world footage. To activate the 2D stabilizer, you need to "
"set the toggle in the panel, and additionally you need to enable *Show "
"Stable* in the Clip Display pop-over. Then you'll need to set up some "
"tracking points to detect the image movements."

"on the average contribution of these tracks, a compensating movement is "
"calculated and applied to each frame."
