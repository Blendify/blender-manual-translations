#~ msgid "Can be used to disable displaying of rectangles which correspond to pattern areas of tracks. In some cases it helps to make the clip view cleaner to check how good tracking is."

#~ msgid "Can be used to disable displaying of rectangles which correspond to search areas of tracks. In some cases it helps to make the clip view cleaner to check how good tracking is. Only search areas for selected tracks will be displayed."

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Show Disabled :kbd:`Alt-D`"

#~ msgstr "Dấu Mốc 3D -- 3D Markers"

#~ msgid "Makes sense after solving the movie clip, and it works in the following way: the solved position of each track gets projected back to the movie clip and displayed as a small point. The color of the point depends on the distance between the projected coordinate and the original coordinate: if they are close enough, the point is green, otherwise it will be red. This helps to find tracks which were not solved nicely and need to be tweaked."

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "The way in which markers are displayed compact (black outline and yellow foreground color) makes tracks visible on all kind of footage (both dark and light). But sometimes it can be annoying and this option will make the marker display more compactly -- the outline is replaced by dashed black lines drawn on top of the foreground, so that marker areas are only 1px thick."
