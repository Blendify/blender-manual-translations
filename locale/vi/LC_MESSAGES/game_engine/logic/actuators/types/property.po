"You set up two *Collision* sensors, one for enemy bullets, and one for "
"picking up more health. The first one is connected (through an *AND* "
"controller) to an *Add Property* actuator with the property ``hp`` and "
"the value -10. Every time the player is hit by an enemy bullet he loses "
"10 HP. The other sensor is connected (through an *AND* controller) to an "
"other *Add Property* actuator, this one with the value 50. So every time "
"the player collides with a health item the HP increases by 50. Next you "
"set up a *Property* sensor for an interval, greater than 100. This is "
"connected (through an *AND* controller) to an *Assign Property* actuator "
"which is set to 100. So if the players HP increases over 100 it is set to"
" 100."
