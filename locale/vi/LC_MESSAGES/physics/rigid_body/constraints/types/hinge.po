"The hinge permits 1 degree of freedom between two objects. Translation is"
" completely constrained. Rotation is permitted about the Z axis of the "
"object hosting the Physics constraint (usually an :term:`empty`, distinct"

"rotation of the object hosting the constraint allows you to control the "
"anchor and axis of the hinge."
