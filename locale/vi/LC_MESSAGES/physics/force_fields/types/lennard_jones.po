"The *Lennard-Jones* force field is a very short range force with a "
"behavior determined by the sizes of the effector and effected particle. "
"At a distance smaller than the combined sizes, the field is very "
"repulsive and after that distance it is attractive. It tries to keep the "
"particles at an equilibrium distance from each other. Particles need to "
"be at a close proximity to each other to be effected by this field at "
"all."

"Particles can have for example both a charge and a Lennard-Jones "
