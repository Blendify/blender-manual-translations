"After you have set up the deflection mesh for the frame range you intend "

"The cache contains the shape of the mesh at each frame. You can edit the "
"cached simulation, after you have baked the simulation and pressed the "
"*Bake Editing* button. Just go to the frame you want to fix and "
":kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode*. There you can move your vertices using all "
"of Blender's mesh shaping tools. When you exit, the shape of the mesh "
"will be recorded for that frame of the animation. If you want Blender to "
"resume the simulation using the new shape going forward, :kbd:`LMB` click"
" *Rebake from next Frame* and play the animation. Blender will then pick "
"up with that shape and resume the simulation."

"If you add, delete, or extrude vertices in the mesh, Blender will take "
"the new mesh as the starting shape of the mesh back to the *first frame* "
"of the animation, replacing the original shape you started with, up to "
"the frame you were on when you edited the mesh. Therefore, if you change "
"the content of a mesh, when you press :kbd:`Tab` out of *Edit Mode*, you "
"should unprotect and clear the cache so that Blender will make a "
"consistent simulation."
