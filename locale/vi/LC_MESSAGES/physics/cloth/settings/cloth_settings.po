msgid "Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing springs. Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one part of a cloth mesh toward vertices in another part of the cloth mesh. This is different from pinning which binds vertices of the cloth mesh in place or to another object. A clasp on a cloak could be created with a sewing spring. The spring could pull two corners of a cloak about a character's neck. This could result in a more realistic simulation than pinning the cloak to the character's neck since the cloak would be free to slide about the character's neck and shoulders."
