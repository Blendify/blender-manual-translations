msgid "Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing springs. Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one part of a cloth mesh toward vertices in another part of the cloth mesh. This is different from pinning which binds vertices of the cloth mesh in place or to another object. A clasp on a cloak could be created with a sewing spring. The spring could pull two corners of a cloak about a character's neck. This could result in a more realistic simulation than pinning the cloak to the character's neck since the cloak would be free to slide about the character's neck and shoulders."

msgid "Allows animating the rest shape of cloth using shape keys or modifiers (e.g. an Armature modifier or any deformation modifier) placed above the Cloth modifier. When it is enabled, the rest shape is recalculated every frame, allowing unpinned cloth to squash and stretch following the character with the help of shape keys or modifiers, but otherwise move freely under control of the physics simulation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/cloth/settings/shape.rst:56
msgid "Normally cloth uses the state of the object in the first frame to compute the natural rest shape of the cloth, and keeps that constant throughout the simulation. This is reasonable for fully realistic scenes, but does not quite work for clothing on cartoon style characters that use a lot of squash and stretch."
