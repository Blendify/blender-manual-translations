"Fluid physics are used to simulate physical properties of liquids "
"especially water. While creating a scene in Blender, certain objects can "
"be marked to participate in the fluid simulation. These can include but "
"not limited to, being a fluid or as an obstacle. For a fluid simulation "
"you have to have a domain to define the space that the simulation takes "
"up. In the domain settings you will be able to define the global "
"simulation parameters (such as viscosity and gravity)."
