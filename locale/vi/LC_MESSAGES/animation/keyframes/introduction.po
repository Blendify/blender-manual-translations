msgid "A *Keyframe* is simply a marker of time which stores the value of a property."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:8
msgid "For example, a Keyframe might define that the horizontal position of a cube is at 3m on frame 1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:10
msgid "The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, meaning, for example, that the user could then add another key on frame 10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20m, and Blender will automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the frames between frame 1 and 10 depending on the chosen interpolation method (e.g. Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc.)."

msgstr "Giới Thiệu -- Introduction"

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:35
msgid "Keyframe interpolation is represented and controlled by :doc:`animation curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>`, also known as :term:`F-Curves <F-Curve>`. These curves can be viewed and modified via the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/index>`."

msgid "The :ref:`Interpolation Mode <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-interpolation>` is the main setting that specifies for each keyframe how the curve is interpolated from that key to the next one. There are a number of modes with fixed shapes, e.g. *Constant*, *Linear*, *Quadratic* etc, and a free form *Bézier* mode."

msgid "*Bézier* interpolation is controlled by handles, which have a :ref:`handle type <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>` and position. The position of *Free* and *Aligned* handles must be set manually from the Graph editor, while *Vector*, *Automatic* and *Auto Clamped* handles are computed automatically from keyframe values."

msgid "Handle smoothing modes. Yellow: *None*, Cyan: *Continuous Acceleration*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:72
msgid "The method how the three automatic handle types are computed is controlled by the per-curve :ref:`Auto Handle Smoothing <graph_editor-auto-handle-smoothing>` setting. The *None* mode resembles how most other software works and only considers the values of the immediately adjacent keys. The *Continuous Acceleration* mode considers the shape of the whole curve, which produces smoother results out of the box, but means that changes in one key affect interpolation over a larger section of the curve; it also tends to overshoot more with *Automatic* handles."
