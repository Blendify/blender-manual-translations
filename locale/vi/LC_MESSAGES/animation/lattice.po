msgid "Lattice -- or commonly called deformation cage outside of Blender. A lattice consists of a three-dimensional non-renderable grid of vertices. Its main use is to apply a deformation to the object it controls with a :doc:`/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice`. If the object is parented with *Lattice Deform* a Lattice Modifier is automatically applied."
