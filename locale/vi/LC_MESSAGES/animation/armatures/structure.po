"Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by"
" default) rigid elements. But you have more possibilities than with real "
"skeletons: In addition to the \"natural\" rotation of bones, you can also"
" move and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be connected to "
"each other; they can be completely free if you want. However, the most "
"natural and useful setups imply that some bones are related to others, "
"forming so-called \"chains of bones\", which create some sort of "
"\"limbs\" in your armature, as detailed in `Chains of Bones`_."
