"The *Floor* constraint allows you to use its target position (and "
"optionally rotation) to specify a plane with a \"forbidden side\", where "
"the owner cannot go. This plane can have any orientation you like. In "
"other words, it creates a floor (or a ceiling, or a wall)! Note that it "
"is only capable of simulating entirely flat planes, even if you use the "
"*Vertex Group* option. It cannot be used for uneven floors or walls."

"not only define an uncrossable plane, but also a side of it which is "
