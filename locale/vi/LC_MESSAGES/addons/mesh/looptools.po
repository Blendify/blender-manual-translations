"There are two main ways to use the Bridge tool, both of which are "
"illustrated in the image below. The first method is to select two groups "
"of faces and then run the tool. The second method is to select two "
"(closed) loops of edges. Both methods can be mixed and you can even "
"Bridge multiple groups at the same time. The script will try to make an "
"educated guess on which groups should be connected."

msgid ""
"The number of faces used to bridge the distance between two loops. One "
"segment means that only faces will be created. Two (or more) segments "
"means that an intermediary line (or lines) of vertices is created, so two"
" or more faces can be defined between the loops. If the value is set to "
"zero, the script automatically calculates the best amount of segments in "
"order to keep the faces as square as possible."

"This option has no label, but is located directly to the right of the "
"segments setting. The simple explanation: 0% lot of triangles, 100% "
"mostly square faces. There is a bit more to it though. It determines when"
" a new vertex has to be created, or when to use the vertex next to it. It"
" does this based on the distance between these vertices compared to the "
"distance between the vertices in the original loops. So 50% means that if"
" the distance between two vertices that will be newly created is smaller "
"than half the distance between two vertices in the original loop, they "
"will be merged together, resulting in only a single new vertex. This is "
"also demonstrated in the video above."

" Setting a negative strength changes the direction of the curve. Or "
"described in a more visual way: it makes deflated volumes inflate and "
"vice versa. The soft limits of this option are set to range from -3 to "
"+3, but you can easily assign bigger or smaller values by manually "
"entering a number, instead of using the slider. This works just the same "
