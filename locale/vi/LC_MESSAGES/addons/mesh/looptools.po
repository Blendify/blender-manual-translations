"This option has no label, but is located directly to the right of the "

"mostly square faces. There is a bit more to it though. It determines when"
" a new vertex has to be created, or when to use the vertex next to it. It"
" does this based on the distance between these vertices compared to the "
"distance between the vertices in the original loops. So 50% means that if"
" the distance between two vertices that will be newly created is smaller "
"than half the distance between two vertices in the original loop, they "
"will be merged together, resulting in only a single new vertex. This is "
"also demonstrated in the video above."
