"The *Spline IK* constraint aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By "
"leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing "
"shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well-integrated "
"control offered by bones, *Spline IK* is an invaluable tool in the "
"riggers' toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible "
"body parts such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic "
"items such as ropes."
