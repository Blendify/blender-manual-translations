"The Logic Editor provides the main method of setting up and editing the game"
" logic for the various actors (i.e. objects) that make up the game. The "
"logic for the objects which are currently selected in the associated 3D "
"panel are displayed as logic bricks, which are shown as a table with three "
"columns, showing sensors, controllers, and actuators, respectively. The "
"links joining the logic bricks conduct the pulses between sensor-controller "
"and controller-actuator."
