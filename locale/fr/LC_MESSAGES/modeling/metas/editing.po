"`Object Families`_), the stiffness is specific to each meta."

"Scaling the inner green circle changes the *Stiffness* value. Stiffness "
"defines how much the meta object is filled. This essentially defines how "
"sensitive a meta is to being affected by other metas. With a low stiffness, "
"the meta will begin to deform from further away. A higher value means the "
"meta needs to be close to another one to begin merging."

"When a *Meta* object comes within \"range\" of another meta, the two will "
"begin to interact with each other. They don't necessarily need to intersect,"

"The range is from **0.0** to **10.0**. But to be visible, the *Stiffness* "

"The *base* *Meta* object determines the basis, the resolution, the "

"The *base* *Meta* object controls the **polygonalization** (mesh structure) "

"This discussion of \"polygonization\" *doesn't* mean that the various meshes"
" don't deform towards or away from each other (meta objects always influence"
" one another in the usual way, whether or not they are members of the same "
"family). Rather, it means that the underlying mesh structure changes only "
"when the *base* object transforms. For example, if you scale the *base*, the"
" children's mesh structure changes. In (*Scaling the \"base\"*), the *base* "
"has been scaled down, which has the effect of scaling the mesh structure of "
"each of the children. As you can see, the children's mesh resolution has "
"increased, while the *base* decreased. *The children did not change size!*"
