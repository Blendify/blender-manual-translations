"Mesh analysis is useful for displaying attributes of the mesh that may "
"impact certain use cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:11
msgid ""
"The mesh analysis works in editmode and shows areas with a high value in "
"red, and areas with a low value in blue. Geometry outside the range is "
"displayed grey."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:15
msgid "Currently the different modes target 3d-printing as their primary use."

msgid "Overhang"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:27
msgid ""
"Extrusion 3D printers have a physical limit to the overhang that can be "
"printed, this display mode shows the overhang with angle range and axis "
"selection."

msgid "Thickness"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:40
msgid ""
"Printers have a limited *wall-thickness* where very thin areas can't be "
"printed, this test uses ray casting and a distance range to the thickness of"
" the geometry."

msgid "Intersecting faces"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:53
msgid ""
"Another common cause of problems for printing are intersections between "
"surfaces, where the inside/outside of a model can't be reliably detected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:56
msgid ""
"Unlike other display modes, intersections have no variance and are either on"

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:68
msgid ""
"Distorted geometry can cause problems since the triangulation of a distorted"
" ngon is undefined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:70
msgid ""
"Distortion is measured by faces which are not flat, with parts of the face "
"pointing in different directions."

"Similar to wall-thickness, sharp edges can form shapes that are too thin to "
"be able to print."
