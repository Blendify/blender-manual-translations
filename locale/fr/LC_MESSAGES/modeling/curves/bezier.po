"The main elements used in editing Bézier Curves are the Control Points "
"and Handles. A Segment (the actual Curve) is found between two Control "
"Points. In the image below, the Control Points can be found in the middle"
" of the pink line while the Handles comprise the extensions from the "
"Control Point. By default the arrows on the Segment represents the "
"direction and *relative* speed and direction of movement Objects will "
"have when moving along the curve. This can be altered by defining a "
"custom F-Curve."
