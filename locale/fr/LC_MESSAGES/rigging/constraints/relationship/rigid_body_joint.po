"The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special. Basically, it is used "
"by the physical part of the Blender Game Engine to simulate a joint "
"between its owner and its target. It offers four joint types: hinge type,"
" ball-and-socket type, cone-twist, and generic six-DoF (degrees of "
"freedom) type."

msgid ""
"The joint point and axes are defined and fixed relative to the owner. The"
" target moves as if it were stuck to the center point of a stick, the "
"other end of the stick rotating around the joint/pivot point..."

"This constraint is of no use in most \"standard\" static or animated "
"projects. However, you can use its results outside of the BGE, through "
"the :menuselection:`Game --> Record Animation` menu entry (from the main "
"menu of the *User Preferences* window, see :doc:`Rigid Bodies "
"</game_engine/physics/using_ge>` for more info on this topic)."
