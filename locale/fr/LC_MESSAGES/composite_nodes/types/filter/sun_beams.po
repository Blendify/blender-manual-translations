"Sun Beams is a 2D effect for simulating the effect of bright light getting "
"scattered in a medium `(Crepuscular Rays) "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays>`__. This phenomenon can be "
"created by renderers, but full volumetric lighting is a rather arduous "
"approach and takes a lot of render time. Also when working with 2D images "
"only the volumetric data may not be available. In these cases the \"Sun "
"Beams\" node provides a computationally cheap way of creating a convincing "
"effect based on image brightness alone."

"Usually the first step is to define the area from which rays are cast. Any "
"diffuse reflected light from surfaces is not going to contribute to such "
"scattering in the real world, so should be excluded from the input data. "
"Possible ways to achieve this are"

"After generating the sun beams from such a light source image they can then "
"be overlayed on the original image. Usually a simple \"Add\" mix node is "
"sufficient, and physically correct because the scattered light adds to the "
"final result."
