msgid ""
"The *Color Spill* node reduces one of the RGB channels so that it is not "
"greater than any of the others. This is common when compositing images that "
"were shot in front of a green or blue screen. In some cases, if the "
"foreground object is reflective, it will show the green or blue color; that "
"color has \"spilled\" onto the foreground object. If there is light from the"
" side or back, and the foreground actor is wearing white, it is possible to "
"get \"spill\" green (or blue) light from the background onto the foreground "
"objects, coloring them with a tinge of green or blue. To remove the green "
"(or blue) light, you use this fancy node."

"The *Enhance* slider allows you to reduce the selected channel's input to "
"the image greater than the color spill algorithm normally allows. This is "
"useful for exceptionally high amounts of color spill."
