"The ColorRamp Node is used for mapping values to colors with the use of a "
"gradient. It works exactly the same way as a :doc:`Colorband for textures "
"and materials </render/blender_render/materials/properties/ramps>`, using "
"the Factor value as a slider or index to the color ramp shown, and "
"outputting a color value and an alpha value from the output sockets."

"By default, the ColorRamp is added to the node map with two colors at "
"opposite ends of the spectrum. A completely black black is on the left "
"(Black as shown in the swatch with an Alpha value of 1.00) and a whitewash "
"white is on the right."

"A powerful but often overlooked feature of the ColorRamp is to create an "
"Alpha Mask, or a mask that is overlaid on top of another image, and, like a "
"mask, allows some of the background to show through. The example map below "
"shows how to use the Color Ramp node to do this:"

"In the map above, a black and white swirl image, which is lacking an alpha "
"channel, is fed into the ColorRamp node as a *Fac* tor. (Technically, we "
"should have converted the image to a value using the RGB-to-BW node, buy "
"hey, this works just as well since we are using a BW image as input.)"

"We have set the ColorRamp node to a purely transparent color on the left end"
" of the spectrum, and a fully Red color on the right. As seen in the viewer,"
" the ColorRamp node puts out a mask that is fully transparent where the "
"image is black. Black is zero, so ColorRamp uses the 'color' at the left end"
" of the spectrum, which we have set to transparent. The ColorRamp image is "
"fully red and opaque where the image is white (1.00)."

"We verify that the output image mask is indeed transparent by overlaying it "
"on top of a pumpkin image. For fun, we made that AlphaOver output image 0.66"
" transparent so that we can, in the future, overlay the image on a flashing "
"white background to simulate a scary scene with lighting flashes."

"The real power of ColorRamp is that multiple colors can be added to the "
"color spectrum. This example compositing map takes a boring BW image and "

"In this example, we have mapped the shades of gray in the input image to "
"three colors, blue, yellow, and red, all fully opaque (Alpha of 1.00). Where"
" the image is black, ColorRamp substitutes blue, the currently selected "
"color. Where it is some shade of gray, ColorRamp chooses a corresponding "
"color from the spectrum (bluish, yellow, to reddish). Where the image is "
"fully white, ColorRamp chooses red."
