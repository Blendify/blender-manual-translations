"The *SplitViewer* node takes two images and displays one half of each on "
"each side (top socket on the right half, bottom socket input on the left). "
"Use this node for making side-by-side comparisons of two renderings/images, "
"perhaps from different renderlayers or from different scenes. When "
"transitioning between scenes, you want to be sure the stop action is "
"seamless; use this node to compare the end of one scene with the beginning "
"of another to ensure they align."
