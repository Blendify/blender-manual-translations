"For correct results, different color spaces are needed for rendering, "
"display and storage of images. Rendering and compositing is best done in "
"scene *linear* color space, which corresponds more closely to nature, and"
" makes computations more physically accurate."

msgid ""
"If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality we double the "
"amount of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if"
" we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those"
" images together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with "
"both lights on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is "
"best for photorealistic rendering and compositing."

"However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or "
"the way display devices work, and image files are often stored in "
"different color spaces, so we have to take care to do the right "
"conversion into and out of this linear color space."

"There is also an artistic choice to be made for renders. Partially that "
"is because display devices cannot display the full spectrum of colors and"
" only have limited brightness, so we can squeeze the colors to fit in the"
" gamut of the device. Besides that it can also be useful to give the "
"renders a particular look, e.g. as if they have been printed on real "
"film."
