"Dithering is a technique for blurring pixels to prevent banding that is seen"
" in areas of gradients, where stair-stepping appears between colors. Banding"
" artifacts are more noticeable when gradients are longer, or less steep. "
"Dithering was developed for graphics with low bit depths, meaning they had a"
" limited range of possible colors."

"Dithering works by taking pixel values and comparing them with a threshold "
"and neighboring pixels then does calculations to generate the appropriate "
"color. Dithering creates the perceived effect of a larger color palette by "
"creating a sort of visual color mixing. For example, if you take a grid and "
"distribute red and yellow pixels evenly across it, the image would appear to"
" be orange."
