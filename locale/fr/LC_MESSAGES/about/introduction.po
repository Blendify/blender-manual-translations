"The Blender manual maintainers are divided into administrators, section "
"owners, section members and contributors. Before you can edit the "
"documentation directly, you need to submit patches for review, similarly to "
"how Blender's own development process works. Straight-forward patches are "
"bound to be accepted very quickly and once you get accustomed to making "
"changes and no longer need feedback, you will gain commit access."

"Administrators are responsible for managing the whole project and "

"Communication is a very important step of community development. Before you "
"make any edits that are not simple and plainly justified (for example, "
"moving folders around), you should verify with a manual maintainer that your"
" contribution is along the community's vision for the manual. This ensures "
"best use of your time and good will as it is otherwise possible that, for "
"some reason, your changes will conflict and be rejected or need time-"
"consuming review. For example, another person may be already working on the "
"section you wish to change, the section may be scheduled for deletion or to "
"be updated according to a planned change to Blender."

"Manual maintainers and the general community can also point to areas that "
"are in need of big or small changes. Communicating early and frequently is "
"key to have a productive environment, to not waste people's effort and to "
"attain a better Blender manual as a result."
