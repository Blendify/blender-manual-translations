#~ "The Blender manual maintainers are "

#~ " section members and contributors. Before"
#~ " you can edit the documentation "
#~ "directly, you need to submit patches "
#~ "for review, similarly to how Blender's"
#~ " own development process works. "
#~ "Straight-forward patches are bound to "

#~ "you get accustomed to making changes "
#~ "and no longer need feedback, you "
#~ "will gain commit access."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ "Communication is a very important step"
#~ " in community development. Before you "
#~ "make any edits that are not simple"
#~ " and plainly justified (for example, "
#~ "moving folders around), you should "
#~ "verify with a manual maintainer that "
#~ "your contribution is along the "
#~ "community's vision for the manual. This"
#~ " ensures the best use of your "
#~ "time and good will as it is "
#~ "otherwise possible that, for some "
#~ "reason, your changes will conflict and"
#~ " be rejected or need time-consuming"
#~ " review. For example, another person "
#~ "may be already working on the "
#~ "section you wish to change, the "
#~ "section may be scheduled for deletion"
#~ " or to be updated according to "
#~ "a planned change to Blender."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Manual maintainers and the general "
#~ "community can also point to areas "
#~ "that are in need of big or "
#~ "small changes. Communicating early and "
#~ "frequently is the key to have a"
#~ " productive environment, to not waste "
#~ "people's effort and to attain a "
#~ "better Blender manual as a result."
