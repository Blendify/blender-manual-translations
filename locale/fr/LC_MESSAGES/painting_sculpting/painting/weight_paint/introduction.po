"Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated "
"vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned "

"information in a very intuitive way. It is primarily used for rigging "
"meshes, where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone "
"influences on the mesh. But we use it also for controlling particle "
