"The complete path of the particles is calculated in advance. So everything a"

"every frame of the particle animation point by point there are calculated "
"control points with an interpolation, the segments."

"Set the amount of hair strands. Use as little particles as possible, "

"a lot more particles if you plan to cover a body with fur. Volume will be "
"produced later with *Children*."
