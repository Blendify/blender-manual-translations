"down processing times, like for instance when the world background is "
"visible, which in general tends to be the point of maximum blur (not "
"always true, objects very close to the lens might be blurred even more). "

"The defocus node is not perfect: some artifacts may occur. One such "

" the differences in distance are very large and the result can look quite"
" bad. The node tries to prevent this from occurring by testing that the "
"blur difference between pixels is not too large, the value set here "
"controls how large that blur difference may be to consider it 'safe.' "
"This is all probably quite confusing, and fortunately, in general, there "
"is no need to change the default setting of 1. Only try changing it if "
"you experience problems with any in-focus object."

"using a limited amount of (quasi)random samples, which is a *lot* faster "
"than the 'perfect' mode used otherwise. The sampling mode also tends to "
"produce grainy, noisy pictures (though the more samples you use, the less"

"other parameters until you are happy with the results, and only then "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/filter/defocus.rst:116
msgid ""
"Sometimes you might want to have more control to blur the image. For "
"instance, you may want to only blur one object while leaving everything "
"else alone (or the other way around), or you want to blur the whole image"
" uniformly all at once. The node, therefore, allows you to use something "
"other than an actual Z-buffer as the *Z* input. For instance, you could "
"connect an image node and use a grayscale image where the color "
"designates how much to blur the image at that point, where white is the "
"maximum blur and black is no blur. Or, you could use a Time node to "
"uniformly blur the image, where the time value controls the maximum blur "
"for that frame. It may also be used to obtain a possibly slightly better "
"DoF blur, by using a fake depth shaded image instead of a Z-buffer. (A "
"typical method to create the fake depth shaded image is by using a linear"
" blend texture for all objects in the scene or by using the 'fog/mist' "
"fake depth shading method.) This also has the advantage that the fake "
"depth image can have anti-aliasing, which is not possible with a real "
"Z-buffer. *No Z-buffer* will be enabled automatically whenever you "
"connect a node that is not image based (e.g. time node/value node/etc)."

msgid ""
"Only visible when *No Z-buffer* enabled. When *No Z-buffer* is used, the "
"input is used directly to control the blur radius. And since usually the "
"value of a texture is only in the numeric range 0.0 to 1.0, its range is "
"too narrow to control the blur properly. This parameter can be used to "
"expand the range of the input (or for that matter, narrow it as well, by "
"setting it to a value less than one). So for *No Z-buffer*, this "
"parameter therefore then becomes the main blur control (similar to "
"*f-Stop* when you *do* use a Z-buffer)."

"Keep in mind that this is not 'real' DoF, only a post-processing "

"real world, using shallow depth of field, it is not impossible for nearby"
" objects to become completely invisible, in effect allowing the camera to"
" see 'behind' it. Hollywood cinematographers use this visual "
"characteristic to to achieve the popular \"focus pull\" effect, where the"
" focus shifts from a nearby to a distant object, such that the \"other\" "
