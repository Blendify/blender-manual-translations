"The *Action Editor* enables you to see and edit the F-Curve data-blocks "
"you defined as :doc:`Actions </animation/actions>` in the *F-Curve "
"Editor*. So it takes place somewhere in-between the low-level "
":doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, and the high-level "
":doc:`NLA editor </editors/nla/index>`."

"Each Action data-block forms a top-level channel (see below). Note that "
"an object can have several *Constraint* (one per animated constraint) and"
" *Pose* (for armatures, one per animated bone) F-Curve data-blocks, and "
"hence an action can have several of these channels."
