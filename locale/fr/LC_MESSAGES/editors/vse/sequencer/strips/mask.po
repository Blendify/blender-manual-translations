"The Mask strip generates a mask image from the selected mask data-block "
"generated in the :doc:`Movie Clip Editor "
"</editors/movie_clip_editor/masking/index>`. This works similar to the "
":doc:`Mask Node </compositing/types/input/mask>` but without the options "
"available for finer control. The mask image is always generated at the "
"render resolution, scaling along with different proxy levels."
