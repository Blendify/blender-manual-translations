"For example, if you have a brown pixel RGB(0.50, 0.29, 0.05), and you "
"multiply it with a cyan filter (uniform color RGB(0.0, 1.0, 1.0), you "
"will get a color RGB(0.0, 0.29, 0.5). Visually, the result is to kill the"
" reds and bring up (by \"symmetry\" -- the real values remain unchanged!)"
" the blues an greens. Physically, it is the same effect as shining a cyan"
" light onto a chocolate bar. Emotionally, vegetation becomes more lush, "
"water becomes more Caribbean and inviting, skies become friendlier."

"This effect reduces the global luminosity of the picture (the result will"
