"The wipe effect is a type of transition strip. It can be used to "
"transition from one strip to the next. The wipe will have no effect if "
"created from a single strip instead of two strips. The duration of the "
"wipe is the intersection of the two source strips and can not be "
"adjusted. To adjust the start and end of the wipe you must adjust the "
"temporal bounds of the source strips in a way that alters their "
"intersection."
