#~ "automatically overlays the image on top"
#~ " of a lower level strip. Autoblending"

#~ "the strip is from broadcast video "
#~ "and has even or odd interlacing "
#~ "fields. Enhance the color saturation "
#~ "through the Multiply field. Play a "
#~ "strip backwards by enabling Reverse "
#~ "Frames. Tell Blender to display every"
#~ " nth frame by entering a Strobe "
#~ "value. Finally, when using MPEG video"
#~ " (VCD, DVD, XVid, DivX, ...), an "
#~ "image is built up over the course"
#~ " of a few frames; use the "
#~ "Preseek field to tell Blender to "

#~ "based on the n previous frames "
