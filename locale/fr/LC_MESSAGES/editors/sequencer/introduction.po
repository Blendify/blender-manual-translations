"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender has a fully functional Video "
"Sequence Editor (VSE) as well as an advanced node-based editor that also "
"manipulates a video stream. :doc:`Compositing Nodes "
"</composite_nodes/types/index>` operate equally well on images or video "
"streams, and can apply detailed image manipulation on the stream."

"The VSE within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to"
" combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can use these "
"effects to create powerful video edits (especially when you combine it with "
"the animation power of Blender!) Furthermore, it is extensible via a plugin "
"system to perform an unlimited number of image manipulations."

"Using the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or in "
"some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link the end "
"of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, add an audio track so you "
"can synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it. The result of "
"using the VSE is your finished movie."

"The Video Sequence Editor has a header (where the menu and view modes are "
"shown) and a workspace, and works in one of several view modes. The Marker "
"menu allows you to add markers in the VSE. Markers are shared across "
"animation editors. See :doc:`Markers </animation/markers>`"

"The sequencer workspace is horizontally striped into channels and each video"
" strip will go in a horizontal channel. Each channel is numbered on the "
"left-hand side, starting from 0 (you can't put anything thing in this "
"special one!) and going up. Stripes toward the bottom are more dominant, "
"which we'll get to in a minute. In the x direction, seconds of animation or "
"frames of animation (:kbd:`Ctrl-T` to choose) are used as the measure of "
"time (seconds 1 through 7 are shown). You can scale the time using the zoom "
"keys or mouse actions (see the Reference for more info)."
