"This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, "
"vertices around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to mimic "
"the stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight (10 - "
"40%) paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a little "
"when the bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically assign "
"weights to an armature (see the :doc:`skinning section </animation/"
"armatures/skinning/index>`), you can do this manually. To do this from "
"scratch, refer to the process below. To modify automatically assigned "
"weights, jump into the middle of the process where noted:"
