"Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and/or a "
"background scene and, through the compositor, to apply this tracking data"
" to 3D objects (or just one), which have either been created in Blender "
"or imported into the application. Blender's motion tracker supports a "
"couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion tracking, "
"including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special "
"features like the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also be used to"
" move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor, which is "
"available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor."

"运动跟踪被用于跟踪物体的运动，并通过合成器将该数据应用于3D物体。 "
"Blender的运动跟踪支持几个非常强大的工具，二维跟踪和三维运动跟踪，包括摄像头跟踪和目标跟踪，以及一些特殊的功能，如用于合成的平面跟踪。跟踪也可以用于在遮罩编辑器中移动和变形，旋转遮罩，它可以在影片剪辑编辑器中作为特殊模式使用。"

"editor must be split into two, with one switched to the curve or dope "
"sheet view."
msgstr "在跟踪模式下有三种不同的视图可用。你可以使用位于标题栏中的“视图”菜单切换视图模式。当你在影片剪辑编辑器的整个区域中选择一个视图时，它将会改变。因此，要显示曲线或摄影表视图，编辑器必须分成两部分，一个切换到曲线或摄影表视图。"

"所有的摄像机录像过程都会令视频产生一定程度的扭曲（失真）。对此没什么解决方法，这是由光学镜片的原理所决定的。为了得到精确的摄像机运动，需要对焦距和扭曲（失真）"

"Currently, focal length can be automatically obtained only from the "

msgstr "目前，焦距值仅可从摄像机设定或从EXIF信息中自动获取——Blender中并没有内置工具可以估算出焦距。不过有一些工具可以帮助找到近似值来补偿失真。还有全手动操作的工具，让你可以使用被扭曲模型所影响的网格，扭曲的单元格定义了镜头中的直线条。"
