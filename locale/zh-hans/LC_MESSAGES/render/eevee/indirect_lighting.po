"While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out "
"from a lamp object is considered indirect lighting in Eevee. That means "
"distant HDRI lighting (or World) is considered as indirect lighting. "
"Mesh objects using an Emission node is also considered as indirect "
"lighting."

"虽然不完全正确，但在Eevee中，所有不是直接从灯光物体发出的照明都被认为是间"
