"While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out "
"from a light object is considered as indirect lighting in Eevee. That "
"means distant :term:`HDRI` lighting (or World) is considered as indirect "
"lighting. Mesh objects using an Emission node are also considered as "
"indirect lighting."

"虽然不是严格正确，但在eevee中，所有不是从灯光物体直接出来的光照被视为间接照明。 包括 :term:`HDRI` "
