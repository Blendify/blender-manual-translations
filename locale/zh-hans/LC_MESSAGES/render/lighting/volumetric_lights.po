"\"Volumetric lighting is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add "
"lighting effects to a rendered scene. It allows the viewer to see beams "
"of light shining through the environment; seeing sunbeams streaming "
"through an open window is an example of volumetric lighting, also known "
"as God rays. The term seems to have been introduced from cinematography "
"and is now widely applied to 3D modeling and rendering especially in the "
"field of 3D gaming. In volumetric lighting, the light cone emitted by a "
"light source is modeled as a transparent object and considered as a "
"container of a \"volume\": as a result, light has the capability to give "
"the effect of passing through an actual three-dimensional medium (such "
"as fog, dust, smoke, or steam) that is inside its volume, just like in "
"the real world.\""

"\"体积照明是3d 计算机图形中使用的一种技术, 用于将照明效果添加到渲染的场景"
"中。它允许观察者看到光线照射环境;阳光流经敞开的窗户是体积照明的一个例子, "
"也被称为上帝的光线。这个术语似乎是从电影摄影中引入的, 现在被广泛应用于3d "
"建模和渲染, 特别是在3d 游戏领域。在体积照明中, 光源发出的光锥被建模为透明"
"物体, 并被视为 \"体积\" 的容器: 因此，光有能力通过其体积内的实际三维介质"
"（如雾，灰尘，烟雾或蒸汽），就像现实世界一样。“"

"A classic example is the search light with a visible halo/shaft of light "
"being emitted from it as the search light sweeps around."

"一个典型的例子是探照灯，当探照灯扫过周围时，它会发出可见光晕/光轴。"

"By default Blender does not model this aspect of light. For example when "
"Blender lights something with a *Spot* light, you see the objects and "
"area on the floor lit but not the shaft/halo of light coming from the "
"spotlight as it progresses to its target and would get scattered on the "
"way."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，Blender不对光的这一方面进行模拟。例如，当Blender使用 *Spot* "
"灯照亮某些东西时，你会看到地板上的物体和区域被照亮，但不会看到从聚光灯下"
"发出的光的轴/光环, 因为它正在向目标方向发展, 并将在途中散开。"

"The halo/shaft of light is caused in the real world by light being "
"scattered by particles in the air, some of which get diverted into your "
"eye and that you perceive as a halo/shaft of light. The scattering of "
"light from a source can be simulated in Blender using various options, "
"but by default is not activated."
msgstr ""
"光晕/光轴在现实世界中是由于光被空气中的粒子散射而引起的，其中一些粒子会转"
"移到你的眼睛中，而你将会感觉到光晕/光轴效果。可以使用各种选项在Blender中"
"模拟光源的散射，但默认情况下不会激活此效果。"
