"*Indirect Lighting* adds indirect light bouncing of surrounding objects. "
"It models the light that is reflected from other surfaces to the current "
"surface. Is more comprehensive, more physically correct, and produces "
"more realistic images. It is also more computationally expensive. Take a "
"look at the following examples of a scene lit with Direct Lighting and "
"both Direct and Indirect Lighting:"
