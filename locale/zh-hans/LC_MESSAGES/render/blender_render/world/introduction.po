"While these world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a "
"scene, :doc:`compositing nodes </compositing/index>` are often "
"preferred, though more complex to master, for the additional control and "
"options they offer. For example, filtering the Z value (distance from "
"camera) or normals (direction of surfaces) through compositing nodes can "
"further increase the depth and spatial clarity of a scene."
