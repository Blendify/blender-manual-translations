msgid ""
"A computer generated image is made up of pixels; each pixel can of course"
" only be a single color. In the rendering process the rendering engine "
"must therefore assign a single color to each pixel on the basis of what "
"object is shown in that pixel. This often leads to poor results, "
"especially at sharp boundaries, or where thin lines are present, and it "
"is particularly evident for oblique lines."

msgid ""
"To overcome this problem, which is known as *Aliasing*, it is possible to"
" resort to an Anti-Aliasing technique. Basically, each pixel is "
"'oversampled', by rendering it as if it were five pixels or more, and "
"assigning an 'average' color to the rendered pixel."

"The simplest method is to average all samples and make that the pixel "
