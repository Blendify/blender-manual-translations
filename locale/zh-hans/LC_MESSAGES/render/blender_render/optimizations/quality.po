"Many factors go into the quality of the rendered image. Rendering a scene "
"without changing any of the render settings is probably going to produce "
"a rather unpleasant image. In previous chapters, you have learned how to "
"model, shade, texture, and light scenes. Optimizing settings with respect "
"to those areas will help to produce quality images, but there are some "
"important settings that come into play before pressing the render button. "
"These can directly affect the look of the rendered image."

"The next section covers render layers and render passes, both of which "
"allow you to compose an image from several elements of a scene. In some "
"cases it is necessary to render effects straight out of the renderer, "
"rather than creating them in \"post.\""

msgid ""
"One important aspect of 3D rendering that is often overlooked is color "
"management. Without color management, or more commonly, linear rendering, "
"render engines interpret scene lighting correctly, but display them "
"incorrectly on your monitor. Blender simplifies this workflow, but it is "
"important to know how the color space of a rendered image factors into "
"your pipeline."

"Anti-Aliasing removes jagged edges that appear in contrasting areas of "
"color. This is a very important aspect of render quality. Without this "
"render setting, images usually appear particularly CG and amateur."

"Exposure is, in physical terms, the length of time a camera's film or "
"sensor is exposed to light. Longer exposure times create a brighter "
"image. In CG, the recorded light values are offset to simulate longer or "
"shorter exposures. This can be achieved through lighting settings, or "
"better, through :doc:`Color Management settings </render/post_process/"

msgid ""
"Cameras have a certain shutter speed (the length of time the film is "
"exposed to the lights of the scene). Things that are in motion while the "
"picture is taken will have some degree of blurring. Faster-moving objects "
"will appear more blurred than slower objects. This is an important effect "
"in CG because it is an artifact that we expect to see, and when it is "
"missing, an image may not be believable."
