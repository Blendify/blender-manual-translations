"The term *Image Texture* simply means that a graphic image, which is a "
"pixel grid composed of R, G, B, and sometimes Alpha values. It is used as"
" the input source to the texture. As with other types of textures, this "
"information can be used in a number of ways, not only as a simple "
"\"decal\"."

"Texture images take up precious memory space, often being loaded into a "
"special video memory bank that is very fast and very expensive, so it is "
"often very small. So, keep the images as small as possible. A 64×64 image"
" takes up only one fourth the memory of a 128×128 image."

"For photorealistic rendering of objects in animations, often larger image"
" textures are used, because the object might be zoomed in on in camera "
"moves. In general, you want to use a texture sized proportionally to the "
"number of pixels that it will occupy in the final render. Ultimately, you"
" only have a certain amount of physical RAM to hold an image texture and "
"the model and to provide workspace when rendering your image."

"For the most efficient memory usage, image textures should be square, "

"You do not have to UV map the *entire* mesh. The sphere above on the left"

"textures. Only use UV textures for those portions of your mesh where you "
"want very graphic, precise detail. For example, a model of a vase only "
"needs UV texture for the rim where decorative artwork is incorporated. A "
"throw pillow does not need a different image for the back as the front; "
"in fact many throw pillows have a fabric (procedural material) back."

"As another example, you should UV map both eyes of a head to the same "
"image (unless you want one bloodshot and the other clear). Mapping both "
"sides of a face to the same image might not be advisable, because the "
"location of freckles and skin defects are not symmetrical. You could of "
"course change the UV map for one side of the face to slightly offset, but"
" it might be noticeable. Ears are another example where images or section"
" of an image can be mapped to similar faces."
