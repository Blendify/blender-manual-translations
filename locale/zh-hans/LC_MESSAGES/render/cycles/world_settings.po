"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "
"surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. It simulates soft global "
"illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners and at mesh "
"intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is occluded, or "
"blocked. This is a trick that is not physically accurate, but it is "
"useful to emphasize the shapes of surfaces, or as a cheap way to get an "
"effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

"Because *Mist* works by adjusting transparency, this can sometimes cause "

"workaround is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off. The"
" Mist data is still available for compositing even though it is off. Use "
":doc:`Compositing </compositing/index>` to feed the Mist pass to the "
":doc:`Alpha Over </compositing/types/color/alpha_over>` node to blend the"
" background color (or a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered"
" image. This produces the mist effect but since Mist is off the object "
