"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "
"surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. It simulates soft global "
"illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived in corners and at mesh "
"intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient light is occluded, or "
"blocked. This is a trick that is not physically accurate, but it is "
"useful to emphasize the shapes of surfaces, or as a cheap way to get an "
"effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

"the :doc:`Alpha Over </compositing/types/color/alpha_over>` node to "
"blend the background color (or a render layer with just the sky) with "

"Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is "
"directly visible versus one that is indirectly lighting the objects. A "
"simple solution to this is to add a Mix node, with the Blend Factor set "
"to Is Camera Ray. The first input color is then the indirect color, and "
"the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a high-"
"res image for the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting."
