"Cycles supports three types of panoramic cameras; Equirectangular, "
"Fisheye, and Mirror Ball. Note that these cannot be displayed non "
"rendered modes in the viewport, i.e. *Solid* mode; they will only work "
"for the final render."

"Cycles支持三种类型的全景相机类型：等距圆柱(ERP)、鱼眼和镜像球。请注意，这"

"渲染的时候生效。"

"This projection is compatible with the environment texture as used for "
"world shaders, so it can be used to render an environment map. To match "
"the default mapping, set the camera object rotation to (90, 0, -90) or "
"pointing along the positive X axis. This corresponds to looking at the "
"center of the image using the default environment texture mapping."
msgstr ""
"此投影与用于世界着色器的环境纹理兼容，因此可用于渲染环境贴图。要匹配默认"
"贴图，将摄像机对象旋转设置为 (90、 0、 -90) 或沿正 X 轴指向。这对应于使用"
"默认环境纹理映射查看图像中心。"
