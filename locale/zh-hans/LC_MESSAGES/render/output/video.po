msgid ""
"For anyone creating motion graphics or simple text overlays, overscan is an "
"important consideration. Although its origins are rooted in historic analog TV "
"systems, unfortunately even in 2017, for various reasons it can still be an "
"issue with modern digital flatscreen TVs."

msgid ""
"Due to various limitations in analog TV equipment, the displayed image could "
"sometimes end up shifted horizontally or vary in size, which could lead to the "
"area beyond the intended visible picture being shown. This hidden area sometimes "
"contained junk noise, timing signals or closed-caption/subtitle data. To avoid "
"this being visible to the viewer, the standard approach for TV manufacturers was "
"to 'overscan' (zoom in) the displayed picture by a small amount (between "
"5-10% edge crop) to ensure that at no time would the hidden areas be visible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/output/video.rst:32
msgid ""
"Although modern digital electronics have eliminated the issue of shifting image "
"position, unfortunately, some TV manufacturers have included overscan on their "
"flatscreen TVs. Why? Because for many years it was given that the edge of the "
"visible image would rarely be seen, so broadcasters would sometimes overlay "
"'hidden' data to the very edge of the image (e.g. some types of closed "
"captions). Also, legacy analog recordings might still contain unwanted noise "
"around the edge. To avoid consumer complaints, overscan is quite often enabled "
"by default. For some flatscreen TVs, it is not possible to disable it."

"Blender has configurable safe-area markings which can be made visible by "
"selecting the scene camera, then in the camera settings by enabling :ref:`Safe "
"Areas <camera-safe-areas>`. Several presets are available. If you are producing "
"work for a television network or indeed any client, they may have their own "
"rules and requirements on safe area dimensions -- so consult with them."

#: ../../manual/render/output/video.rst:53
msgid ""
"When exporting to many of the common video formats, the rendered RGB(A) images "
"go through a conversion process whereby they are translated to the YCbCr color "
"model. Y corresponds to a grayscale representation of the image, Cb and Cr "
"contain data for the blue and red channels respectively. Green is encoded into "
"the Y and Cb, Cr channels with some clever math."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/output/video.rst:58
msgid ""
"Importantly, the color components are often stored at a lower resolution to the "
"Y (grayscale) channel. This can cause blurring/smearing which can be a problem "
"with small text and some saturated color combinations -- so it is well worth "
"doing test encodes to make sure that text remains legible. As with safe areas, a "
"TV network or client might have their own rules on minimum text size and "
"positioning, so always seek clarification when unsure."
