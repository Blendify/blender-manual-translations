"The angle (orientation) of the virtual drawing tool, from the vertical "
"axis of the picture. For example, an angle of 0.0 mimics a pen aligned "
"with the vertical axis. Hence, the thickest strokes will be the vertical "
"ones i.e. stroke's direction is aligned with the angle, and the thinnest "
"will be the horizontal ones i.e. stroke's direction is perpendicular to "
"the angle."
