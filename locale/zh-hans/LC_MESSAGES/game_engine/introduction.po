"A word of warning, before you start any big or serious project with the "
"Blender Game Engine, you should note that it is currently not very "
"supported and that there are plans for its retargeting and refactoring "
"that, in the very least, will break compatibility. For further "
"information, you should get in touch with the developers via mailing list "
"or IRC and read the `development roadmap <https://code.blender."

msgstr ""
"提醒一下，在你开始使用 Blender 游戏引擎制作任何大型或是严肃的项目之前，你"
"应该注意到，它目前对计划重定向和重构的支持不怎么好，至少会破坏兼容性。欲进"

"Blender has its own built in Game Engine that allows you to create "
"interactive 3D applications or simulations. The major difference between "
"Game Engine and the conventional Blender system is in the rendering "
"process. In the normal Blender engine, images and animations are built "
"off-line -- once rendered they cannot be modified. Conversely, the "
"Blender Game Engine renders scenes continuously in real-time, and "
"incorporates facilities for user interaction during the rendering process."
