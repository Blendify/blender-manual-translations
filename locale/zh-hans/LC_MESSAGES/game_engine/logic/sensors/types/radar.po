"The *Radar Sensor* works much like the :doc:`Near sensor "
"</game_engine/logic/sensors/types/near>`, but only within an angle from "
"an axis, forming an invisible cone with the top in the objects' center "
"and base at a distance on an axis. This sensor is useful for giving bots "
"sight only in front of them, for example."
