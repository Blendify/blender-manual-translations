"Sometimes, you may want to animate a wall being broken down by an "
"object, or a bunch of objects collapsing, falling, or bouncing with "
"accurate physics. You could manually insert keyframes and do trial and "
"error adjusting with F-Curves to simulate physics and acceleration, or, "
"you can do it much easier and automatically by taking advantage of "
"Blender Game Engine Physics. Blender now has a feature which allows you "
"to record animation in a Blender game and turn it into Blender Animation "
"Keyframes."
