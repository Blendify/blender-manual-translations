"A *Charge* force field is similar to a *Force* field except it changes "
"it's behavior (attract/repulse) based on the effected particles charge "
"field (negative/positive), like real particles with a charge. Which means"
" that this field has only an effect on particles that have also a "
"*Charge* field (else, they have no \"charge\", and hence are unaffected)!"

"一个 *电荷* 力场类似于球形场除了它改变行为（吸引/击退）的基础上实现的粒子电荷场（负/正），就像用电荷实粒子。这意味着这个字段只对具有 "
"*电荷* 力场的粒子产生影响(否则，它们没有\"电荷\"，因此不受影响)!"
