"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some "
"fabric. So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to "
"get some good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it "
"several times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit "
"Mode*, and press :kbd:`W` :menuselection:`Specials --> Subdivide multi`, "
"and set it to 8."

"Now, we will make this cloth by going to the Physics tab. Scroll down "
"until you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the *Cloth* button. Now, a "
"lot of settings will appear, most of which we will ignore for now."

"That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if "
"you press :kbd:`Alt-A`, your lovely fabric will just drop very un-"
"spectacularly. That is what we will cover in the next two sections about "
"pinning and colliding."

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid "
"shape and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or "
"so, and the flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* "
"Modifier. If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, "
"re-enable it for the frame range when it is in camera view."

"Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is "
