"Another method of restraining cloth similar to pinning is sewing "
"springs. Sewing springs are virtual springs that pull vertices in one "
"part of a cloth mesh toward vertices in another part of the cloth mesh. "
"This is different from pinning which binds vertices of the cloth mesh in "
"place or to another object. A clasp on a cloak could be created with a "
"sewing spring. The spring could pull two corners of a cloak about a "
"character's neck. This could result in a more realistic simulation than "
"pinning the cloak to the character's neck since the cloak would be free "
"to slide about the character's neck and shoulders."
msgstr ""
"另一种像钉固一样限制布料的方法是缝合弹簧。 缝合弹簧是虚拟弹簧，其将布料网"
"格的一部分中的顶点拉向布网格的另一部分中的顶点。 这与将布料网格的顶点绑定"
"到位或另一个对象的固定不同。 可以用缝纫弹簧制作斗篷上的扣子。 弹簧可以将"
"一个斗篷的两个角落在角色的脖子上。 这可能会导致更真实的模拟，而不是将斗篷"
"钉在角色的脖子上，因为斗篷可以在角色的脖子和肩膀周围自由滑动。"

"Sewing springs are created by adding extra edges to a cloth mesh that "

"that should be pulled together. For example the corners of a cloak."
msgstr ""
"缝合弹簧是通过在布料网格中添加额外边缘而创建的，这些边缘不包含在任何面"
"中。 它们应该连接应当拉在一起的网格中的顶点。 例如斗篷的角落。"

"Normally cloth uses the state of the object in the first frame to "
"compute the natural rest shape of the cloth, and keeps that constant "
