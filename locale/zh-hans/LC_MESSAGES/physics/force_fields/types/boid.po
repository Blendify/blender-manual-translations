"Boid probably comes from theoretical works. *Boids* is an artificial life"
" program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the "
"flocking behavior of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987"
" in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name refers to a "
"\"bird-like object\", but its pronunciation evokes that of \"bird\" in a "
"stereotypical New York accent. As with most artificial life simulations, "
"Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of "
"Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in "
"this case) adhering to a set of simple rules."

"群簇可能来自理论着作。船是1986年Craig "
"Reynolds开发的人造生命计划，它模拟了鸟类的植物行为。他关于这个话题的论文于1987年在ACM "
"SIGGRAPH会议的会议上发表。这个名字是指“鸟类物体”，但它的发音在纽约口音中引起了“鸟”的发音。与大多数人工生命模拟一样，船只是紧急行为的一个例子;"
" 也就是说，群簇的复杂性来自个别代理人（在这种情况下）的互动，遵循一套简单的规则。"
