"The *Lennard Jones* force field is a very short range force with a "
"behavior determined by the sizes of the effector and effected particle. "
"At a distance smaller than the combined sizes, the field is very "
"repulsive and after that distance it is attractive. It tries to keep the "
"particles at an equilibrium distance from each other. Particles need to "
"be at a close proximity to each other to be effected by this field at "
"all."

"在 *兰纳琼斯分子力* "
"力场是非常短的范围内的力与由所述执行器和影响粒子的大小而确定的行为。在距离小于组合尺寸的距离处，该场是非常排斥的，此后距离是有吸引力的。它试图保持颗粒彼此平衡的距离。粒子需要靠近彼此才能被这个领域所影响。"
