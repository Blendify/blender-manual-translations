"Set the amount of hair strands. Use as little particles as possible, "
"especially if you plan to use soft body animation later. But you need enough "
"particles to have good control. For a \"normal\" haircut I found some thousand "
"(very roughly 2000) particles to give enough control. You may need a lot more "
"particles if you plan to cover a body with fur. Volume will be produced later "
"with *Children*."
