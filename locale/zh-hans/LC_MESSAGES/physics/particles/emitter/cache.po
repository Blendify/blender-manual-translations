"*Emitter* systems use a unified system for caching and baking (together "
"with soft body and cloth). The results of the simulation are "
"automatically cached to disk when the animation is played, so that the "
"next time it runs, it can play again quickly by reading in the results "
"from the disk. If you *Bake* the simulation the cache is protected and "
"you will be asked when you are trying to change a setting that will make "
"a recalculating necessary."
