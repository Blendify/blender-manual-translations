"The objects are linked by a point bearing allowing any kind of rotation "
"around the location of the constraint object, but no relative "
"translation is permitted. The physics engine will do its best to make "
"sure that the two points designated by the constraint object on the two "
"constrained objects are coincident."

"物体由点关系连接，允许围绕约束物体的位置进行任何类型的旋转，但不允许相对"
"平移。物理引擎将尽力确保在两个约束物体上指定的两个点一致。"
