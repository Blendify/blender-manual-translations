"Shape keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In "
"other terminology, shape keys may be called \"morph targets\" or \"blend "
"shapes\"."

msgid ""
"The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial "
"animation and in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig. They are "
"particularly useful for modeling organic soft parts and muscles where "
"there is a need for more control over the resulting shape than what can "
"be achieved with combination of rotation and scale."

msgid ""
"It is not possible to add or remove vertices in a shape key. The number "
"of vertices and how they connect is specified by the mesh, curve, surface"
" or lattice. A shape key merely records a position for each vertex and "
"therefore shapes always contain all the object's vertices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/shape_keys/introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in "
"which it is created. Workflow-wise, adding and deleting vertices after "
"creating shape keys is possible, but it is best to leave the creation of "
"shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable."

"When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to"
" first create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or "
"surprise), and then break this complex shape into components by applying "
"a temporary vertex group to the complex shape and creating a copy with "
"*New Shape from Mix*. This technique helps reducing conflicts between "
"different shape keys that would otherwise produce a double effect."
