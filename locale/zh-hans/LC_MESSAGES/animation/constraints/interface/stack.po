"影响物体的所有约束的组合被称为约束堆栈。堆栈位于约束(Constraints)面板中，"
"在\" Add Constraint(添加约束)\"菜单下方。"

"Constraints in the stack are evaluated from top to bottom. The order of "
"each constraint has a substantial impact on the final outcome of the "
"stack. Changing the order of the constraints can change the behavior of "
"the entire stack."

"在堆栈中的约束是从顶部到底部计算的。每个约束的顺序对堆栈的最终结果有实质"

msgid ""
"The constraints in this example stack are evaluated from top to bottom "
"starting with the \"Copy Location\" constraint and ending with the final "
"\"Damped Track\" constraint."
msgstr ""
"此示例堆栈中的约束从上到下进行计算，从 “复制位置” 约束开始，以最终的 “阻"

"To change the order of a constraint use the up/down arrows in the :doc:"

"若要更改约束的顺序在（ :doc:`header 标题栏 </animation/constraints/"
"interface/header>`）中点击向上/向下箭头。"
