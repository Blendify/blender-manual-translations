msgid ""
"The *Locked Track* constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both "
"graphically and textual. Basically, it is a :doc:`Track To constraint </"
"animation/constraints/tracking/track_to>`, but with a locked axis, i.e. "
"an axis that cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner "
"can only track its target by rotating around this axis, and unless the "
"target is in the plane perpendicular to the locked axis, and crossing "
"the owner, this owner cannot really point at its target."
msgstr ""
"*锁定跟踪* 约束很难用图形和文字解释清楚。基本上，它是标准跟踪约束(:doc:"
"`Track To constraint </animation/constraints/tracking/track_to>`)的基础上"
"多了一个锁定轴，即一个轴不能旋转(改变其方向)。因此，其自身只可以通过绕此"
"轴旋转跟踪它的目标，除非目标是在垂直于锁定的轴平面，并和自身相交，否则这"
"个自身不能真正指向它的目标。"

"Let us take the best real-world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to "
"point in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a "
"neighbor magnet), but it cannot point *directly at it*, because it spins "
"like a wheel on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is "
"a magnet directly above it, the compass cannot point to it. If we move "
"the magnet more to one side of the compass, it still cannot point *at* "
"the target, but it can point in the general direction of the target, and "
"still obey its restrictions of the axle."

"让我们采用最好的现实世界：指南针。 它可以旋转到指向其目标的大致方向(磁"

"When using a *Locked Track* constraint, you can think of the target as a "
"magnet, and the owner as a compass. The *Lock* axis will function as the "
"axle around which the owner spins, and the *To* axis will function as "
"the compass' needle. Which axis does what is up to you!"
