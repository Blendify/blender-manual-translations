"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves and NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. "
"Blender internally treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely differently. There are several attributes that separate them but the most "
"important is that a NURBS curve has a single interpolation axis (U) and a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V)."

"理解NURBS曲线和NURBS曲面之间的差异十分重要：前者具有一个维度，后者有两个。Blender内部对NURBS曲面和NURBS曲面的处理方式是完全不同的。可以通过几个属"

"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-mesh-"

"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to a NURBS surface; you have to add a whole U or V row at once (in "
"practice, you will usually use the Extrude tool, or perhaps the Duplicate one, to add those...), containing exactly the same number of points as "
"the others. This also means that you will only be able to \"merge\" different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows matches together."

"重要的是要知道: 不能在NURBS曲面上只添加一个单个的控制点，必须一次添加一整行U或者V行控制点(实际操作中，通常会使用挤出工具或者复制一个, 来添加这些"
