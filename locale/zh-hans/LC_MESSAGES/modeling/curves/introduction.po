"Both Bézier and NURBS curves are named after their mathematical "
"definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they"
" are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's "
"perspective. Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they "
"start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBS curves are "
"more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists "
"and turns in a curve."
msgstr "贝塞尔曲线和NURBs曲线都是以其数学定义所命名，选择使用哪种曲线往往更多考虑的是其后台计算方式，而非从建模者的直观角度考虑。贝塞尔曲线通常更直观，因为其起始点均为控制点，但NURBs曲线在描述有许多波折的曲线方面更高效。"

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
"curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less "
"memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural "
"approach to surfaces can increase demands at render time."
msgstr "使用曲线而非多边形网格的主要优势是，曲线使用更少的数据来描述物体结构，所以在建模时可以使用更少的内存和存储空间来产生结果。然而，此方法所建的曲面会增加渲染时的负担。"

"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a "

"curves. On the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is "
"more difficult and if fine control is necessary, :doc:`mesh editing "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
msgstr ""
"某些建模技术,，如 :doc:`沿路径挤出轮廓 "
"</modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`，只能使用曲线。另一方面，当使用曲线时，顶点级的控制会更加困难，所以如果需要精细控制，:doc:`网格编辑"
