"mathematical functions rather than a series of points."

"Blender offers both :ref:`curve-bezier` and :ref:`curve-nurbs`. Both Bézier curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in "
"terms of a set of \"control points\" (or \"control vertices\") which define a \"control polygon\"."
msgstr ""
"Blender同时提供 :ref:`curve-bezier` 和 :ref:`curve-nurbs` 。贝塞尔曲线，NURBS曲线和曲面都是根据一组“控制点”（或“控制顶点”）定义"
"的，这些点定义了一个“控制多边形”。"

"Both Bézier and NURBs curves are named after their mathematical definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of "
"how they are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's perspective. Bézier curves are generally more "
"intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBs curves are more efficient for the computer to "
"calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."
msgstr ""
"贝塞尔曲线和NURBs曲线都是以其数学定义所命名，选择使用哪种曲线往往更多考虑的是其后台计算方式，而非从建模者的直观角度考虑。贝塞尔曲"
"线通常更直观，因为其起始点均为控制点，但NURBs曲线在描述有许多波折的曲线方面更高效。"

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that curves are defined by less data and so can produce results "
"using less memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural approach to surfaces can increase demands at "
"render time."
msgstr ""
"使用曲线而非多边形网格的主要优势是，曲线使用更少的数据来描述物体结构，所以在建模时可以使用更少的内存和存储空间来产生结果。然而，此"
"方法所建的曲面会增加渲染时的负担。"

"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a path </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, are possible "
"only using curves. On the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is more difficult and if fine control is "
"necessary, :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
msgstr ""
"某些建模技术,，如 :doc:`沿路径挤出轮廓 </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`，只能使用曲线。另一方面，当使用曲线时，顶点级的控制"
"会更加困难，所以如果需要精细控制，:doc:`网格编辑 </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` 可能是一个更好的建模选择。"
