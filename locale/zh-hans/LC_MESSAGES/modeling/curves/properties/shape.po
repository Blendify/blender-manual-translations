"The *resolution* property defines the number of points that are computed "
"between every pair of control points. Curves can be made more or less "
"smooth by increasing and decreasing the resolution respectively. The "
"*Preview U* setting determines the resolution in the 3D View while the "
"*Render U* setting determines the curve's render resolution. If *Render "
"U* is set to zero (0), then the *Preview U* setting is used for both the "
"3D View and render resolution."
msgstr ""
"*分辨率* 属性定义了在每对控制点之间计算的点的数量。通过分别增大和减小分辨"
"率，可以使曲线变得或多或少光滑。 *U向预览* 设置确定3D视图中的分辨率，而 "
"*U向渲染* 设置确定曲线的渲染分辨率。如果 *U向渲染* 设置为0(0)，那么 *U向"
"预览* 设置用于3D视图和渲染的分辨率。"
