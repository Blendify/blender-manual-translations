"The Atomic Blender (PDB/XYZ) add-on imports atomic structures (molecules,"
" crystals, clusters, particles, surfaces, etc.), which are described in "
"PDB (``.pdb``) and XYZ files (``.xyz``) (`Import PDB/XYZ`_). The add-on "
"reads the coordinates of all atoms in the PDB/XYZ file and represents the"
" atoms as balls in the Blender world. Also the sticks, which are "
"described in PDB files only, can be shown if the sticks are listed in the"
" PDB file. For the import, many options can be chosen, which allow "
"representing the atoms and sticks in different ways. With help of several"
" tools  in the `Atomic Blender Utilities panel`_, the atomic structures "
"can be modified after the import. Note that the coordinates of selected "
"atomic structures in the Blender 3D world can also be exported into "
"PDB/XYZ files."
