"Sun Position allows positioning and animating the sun (to a certain "
"degree of accuracy), to simulate real-world natural lighting. It uses "
"physical characteristics to position the sun in the scene: geographic "
"location, time and date. It is based on the Earth System Research "
"Laboratory's `online calculator "

msgid ""
"This add-on has two distinct modes of operation:  the `Normal Mode`_ "
"allows you to animate the sun realistically, while the `Sun + HDRI "
"Texture Mode`_ is useful for synchronizing a sun light to an HDRI "
