msgid ""
"This format is mainly use for interchanging character animations between "

"3/UDK and Unreal Engine 4."

"Bones would need to get a correction to their orientation (FBX bones "
"seems to be -X aligned, Blender’s are Y aligned), this does not affect "

"Animations (FBX AnimStacks, Blender actions) **are not linked** to there "
"object, because there is no real way to know which stack to use as "
"'active' action for a given object, mesh or bone. This may be enhanced to"
" be smarter in future, but not really considered urgent, so for now "
"you'll have to link actions to objects by hand."

"The FBX file format supports files that only contain takes. It is up to "
"you to keep track of which animations belongs to which model. The "
"animation that will be exported is the currently selected action within "
"the Action editor. To reduce the file size, turn off the exporting of any"
" parts you do not want and disable *All Actions*. For armature animations"
" typically you just leave the armature enabled which is necessary for "
"that type of animation. Reducing what is output makes the export and "
"future import much faster. Normally each action will have its own name "
"but the current or only take can be forced to be named \"Default Take\". "
"Typically ensure that this option remains off."
