"F2 (also known as the 'spider-script') extends Blender native "
"functionality of creating faces. It allows you to create a face from a "
"single vertex selection or a single edge selection, while retaining all "

"When a single vertex is selected, a new quad is formed by creating a new "
"vertex. The position of this new vertex is calculated based on the three "
"existing vertices. These are the selected vertex, and two vertices to "
"which it is connected via open edges. An open edge is an edge which is "
"only part of one face, or none at all. The newly created quad has the "
"same material and normal direction as the neighboring faces."
