"Since the actual image elements, i.e. the subject of our footage can be considered stable now, we may use these as a new frame of reference: we "

"But when the camera was *moved intentionally*, we have to consider yet another frame of reference beyond the canvas: namely the frame (or *\"cadre"

"camera was turned towards the right side, the actual image contents move towards the left side *within* the original image frame. But let's assume "
"the stabilizer was successful with \"fixing\" any image contents relative to the *canvas* -- which in turn means, that the original image "
"boundaries start to move irregularly towards the right side, and the *contents* of the image will begin to disappear gradually behind the left "
"boundary of the original image. After some amount of panning, we'll have lost all of our original contents and just see an empty black image "
