"There is one extra panel which is available in reconstruction mode -- 2D "

"camera handling on existing real world footage. To activate the 2D "
"stabilizer, you need to set the toggle in the panel, and additionally you "
"need to enable *Display Stabilization* in the Display panel. Then you'll "
"need to set up some tracking points to detect the image movements."

"average contribution of these tracks, a compensating movement is "
"calculated and applied to each frame."
