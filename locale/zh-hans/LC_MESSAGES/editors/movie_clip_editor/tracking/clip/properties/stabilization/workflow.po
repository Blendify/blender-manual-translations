"Each track contributes to the overall result by the degree controlled "
"through its *Stab Weight* parameter. It is evaluated on a per frame "
"base, which enables us to control the influence of a track by "
"*animating* this *Stab Weight*. You may imagine the overall working of "
"the stabilizer as if each tracking point \"drags\" the image through a "
"flexible spring: When you turn down the *Stab Weight* of a tracking "
"point, you decrease the amount of \"drag\" it creates. Sometimes the "
"contribution of different tracks has to work partially counter each "
"other. This effect might be used to cancel out spurious movement, e.g. "
"as caused by perspective. But when, in such a situation, one of the "
"involved tracks suddenly goes away, a jump in image position or rotation "
"might be the result. Thus, whenever we notice a jump at the very frame "
"where some partially covered track starts or ends, we need to soften the "
"transition. We do so by animating the *Stab Weight* gradually down, so "
"that it reaches zero at the boundary point. In a similar vein, when we "
"plan a \"handover\" between several partially covered tracks, we define "
"a *cross-fade* over the duration where the tracks overlap, again by "
"animating the *Stab Weight* parameters accordingly. But even with such "
"cross-fade smoothing, some residual movement might remain, which then "
"needs to be corrected with the *Expected Position* or *Expected "
"rotation* parameters. It is crucial to avoid \"overshooting\" movements "
"in such a situation -- always strive at setting the animation keyframes "
"onto precisely the same frame number for all the tracks and parameters "
"involved."
