"The next step is to work with the UV layouts that you have created "

msgstr "在整理时，要记得虽然整个视图都是你的创作空间，但是只有位于栅格中的UV坐标才能映射到图像。所以整理过程中，可以将一些部分移到一旁。另外，每一组UV映射的关联坐标集合都是独立的。"

"We can tell that the ear would unwrap nicely with just a straightforward "
"projection from the side view, and the neck with a tubular unwrap. So, "
"our general approach will be to unwrap different parts of the object "
"(face, ears, and so on) using different unwrap calculations, selecting "
"each calculation according to whatever works best for that piece. So let "
"us begin: We select only the \"face\" faces, unwrap them using the "
"*Sphere* calculation, and scale and rotate them somewhat to fit logically"
" within the image area of the UV/Image Editor."
msgstr ""
"不难发现，从侧视图直接投影就可以很好地展开耳朵了，而颈部使用柱面展开即可。所以，常规的方法是对物体的不同部分使用不同的展开算法，根据不同情况选择最恰当的展开算法。所以，我们重新展开：首先仅选择脸部的面，使用"

" show up in the UV/Image Editor)."
msgstr "脸部UV调整好之后，下面把注意力转到耳朵。首先，取消选择脸部。脸部的UV会从UV/图像编辑器消失，但是它还在那，只是隐藏了而已。(要确认的话，在3D视图选择几个面，UV/图像编辑器就会显示对应的UV。)"

" selecting Linked vertices will select that entire submesh. Basically, "
"since you are in Edit Mode, all of the selecting/deselecting features are"
" available to you."
msgstr "要处理耳朵，先在3D视图仅选择耳朵上的面。可以使用顶点组进行选择。选择子网格也一样简单，因为它与网格的其他部分是断开的。只需要选择相连的顶点就可以选中整个子网格了。因为是在编辑模式下，基本上所有的选择/取消选择方法都可以用。"

"painting. All of the detailed instructions on how to do this are "
"contained in the next section. The point of this paragraph is to show you"
" the ultimate goal. Note that the mesh shown is Mirrored along the Z "
"axis, so the right side of the face is virtual; it is an exact copy of "
"the right, so only one set of UVs actually exist. (If more realism is "
"desired, the Mirror Modifier would be applied, resulting in a physical "
"mirror and a complete head. You could then make both side physically "
"different by editing one side and not the other. Unwrapping would produce"
" a full set of UVs (for each side) and painting could thus be different "
"for each side of the face, which is more realistic)."
msgstr "整理和缝合工作结束后，可以获得如上图一样的完整UV映射，这样一张图像就可以囊括整个网格的细节绘制了。细节的做法会在下文介绍。本段的目的在于展示最终的目标。要注意的是，上面的网格是沿Z轴镜像的，所以左侧的脸部是虚拟的；它只是右侧的副本而已，所以其实只存在一组UV。(如果要获得更加真实的效果，需要应用镜像修改器，获得真实的镜像和完整的头部。接下来可以修改一侧，使两侧获得真实的差异。展开过后可以得到一组完整的UV，绘制过后的脸部两侧也会有所不同，更加真实。)"

msgstr "另外需要考虑的就是节约资源。每张图像文件都会被加载到内存里。如果可以对不同的网格重复使用同一张图像，就可以节约内存。所以，比如，可以绘制一个通用的脸部，然后用在不同的角色上，通过调整UV映射和形状以及道具(墨镜)来加以区别。"
