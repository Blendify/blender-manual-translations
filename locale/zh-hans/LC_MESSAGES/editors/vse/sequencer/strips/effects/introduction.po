"Blender offers a set of effects that can be added to your sequence. Each "
"effect is explained in the next pages individually, but they all are "
"added and controlled in the same way."

"Blender提供了一系列可以添加到序列中的效果。每个效果将分别在下一页中介绍，"

"To add an effect strip, select one base strip (image, movie, or scene) "
"by :kbd:`RMB` clicking on it. For some effects, like the Cross "
"transition effect, you will need to :kbd:`Shift-RMB` a second "
"overlapping strip (it depends on the effect you want). Then select :"
"menuselection:`Add --> Effect` and pick the effect you want from the pop-"
"up menu. When you do, the Effect strip will be shown above the source "
"strips. If it is an independent effect, like the :doc:`Color Generator </"
"editors/vse/sequencer/strips/effects/color>`, it will be placed at the "
"position of the frame indicator."
msgstr ""
"要添加一个效果片段，选择一个基础片段（图像，电影或场景）在其上使用  :kbd:"
"`RMB` 点击它。对于一些效果，比如交叉过渡效果，你需要把  :kbd:`Shift-RMB` "
"换成第二条重叠片段（这取决于你想要的效果）。然后选择 :menuselection:`Add "
"--> Effect` ，选择你想要的效果。当你这样做时，效果片段将显示在源片段之"
"上。如果它是一个独立的效果，像 :doc:`Color Generator </editors/vse/"
"sequencer/strips/effects/color>`,它将被放置在帧指示器的位置。"

"Since most Effects strips depend on one or two source strips, their "
"frame location and duration depends on their source strips. Thus, you "
"may not be able to move it; you have to move the source strips in order "
"to affect the effect strip."
msgstr ""
"由于大多数带的影响依赖于一个或两个源片段，其帧的位置和持续时间取决于其源"
"片段。因此，你可能无法将其移动; 你必须移动源片段，以影响效果片段。"

"To use an effect that combines or makes a transitions select two strips, "
"When you add the effect strip, it will be placed in a channel above the "
"two. Its duration will be the overlap between the two strips as a "
"maximum."
msgstr ""
"要使用组合或制作过渡的效果，请选择两个片段，添加效果片段时，它将放置在两"
"个片段上方的通道中。其持续时间将是两条片段之间的重叠最大值。"

"With some effects, like the :doc:`Alpha Over </editors/vse/sequencer/"
"strips/effects/alpha_over_under_overdrop>`, the order in which you "
"select the strips is important. You can also use one effect strip as the "
"input or source strip with another strip, thus layering effects on top "
"of one another."
msgstr ""
"有一些效果，如  :doc:`Alpha Over </editors/vse/sequencer/strips/effects/"
"alpha_over_under_overdrop>`,选择片段的顺序是非常重要的。也可以用一个效果"

"The only exception is the :doc:`Color Generator </editors/vse/sequencer/"
