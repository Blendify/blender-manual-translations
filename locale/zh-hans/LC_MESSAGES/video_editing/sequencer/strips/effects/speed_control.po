"Speed Control time-warps the strip, making it play faster or slower than it "
"normally would. A *Global Speed* less than 1.0 makes the strip play slower; "
"greater than 1.0 makes it play faster. Playing faster means that some frames "
"are skipped, and the strip will run out of frames before the end frame. When "
"the strip runs out of frames to display, it will just keep repeating the last "
"one; action will appear to freeze. To avoid this, position the next strip "
"under the original at a point where you want the motion to continue."

"速度控制会扭曲片段的时间，使其播放得比正常时更快或更慢。一个小于1.0的 *全局速"
"度* 会使片段播放得更快；大于1.0则会使其播放得更快。播放得更快意味着某些帧被跳"

"一帧；动作将会看起来被冻结。为了避免这种情况，将下一个片段放置于原来的片段中你"
"想让动作继续的位置。"

"You can use the speed control to change the frame rate in frames per second "
"(fps) of a video. If you are rendering your video to a sequence set, you can "
"effectively increase or decrease the number of individual image files "
"created, by using a Global Speed value less than or greater than one, "
"respectively. For example, if you captured a five-minute video at 30 fps and "
"wanted to transfer that to film, which runs at 24 fps, you would enter a "
"Global Speed of 30/24, or 1.25 (and Enable Frame Blending to give that film "
"blur feel). Instead of producing ``5 × 60 × 30 = 9000`` frames, Blender would "
"produce ``9000 / 1.25 = 7200 = 5 × 60 × 24`` frames. In this case, you set a "
"*start* = 1 and *end* = 7200, set your Format output to ``jpeg`` 30fps, and "
"image files ``0001.jpg`` through ``7200.jpg`` would be rendered out, but "
"those images cover the entire 9000 frames. The image file ``7200.jpg`` is the "
"same at frame 9000. When you read those images back into your film blend-file "
"at 24 fps, the strip will last exactly 5 minutes."

"你可使用速度控制在视频的每秒传输帧数(fps)内改变帧速率。如果你渲染视频为一个序"
"列集，你可分别通过使用一个小于或大于1的全局速度值有效地增加或减少单个创建的图"
"像的数量。例如，如果你以30fps来录制一个5分钟的视频，并且想转录到24fps的影片"
"中，你将会进入一个30/24的全局速度，或者1.25(激活帧混合以使影片模糊)。Blender"
"会产生 ``9000 / 1.25 = 7200 = 5 × 60 × 24`` 帧，而不是产生 ``5 × 60 × 30 = "
"9000`` 帧。在这种情况下，设置 *起始* =1， *结束* =7200，设置输出格式到30fps的 "
"``jpeg`` ，并且从 ``0001.jpg`` 到 ``7200.jpg`` 的图像文件会渲染输出，但这些图"
"像会涵盖全部的9000帧。``7200.jpg`` 的图像文件与9000帧相同。当你回看24fps的影片"
"blend文件中的图像时，该片段将会确切地持续5分钟。"
