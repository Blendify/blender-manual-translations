msgid ""
"The *Sound Crossfade* transition works by animating the *Volume* of two "
"overlapping sound strips to evenly fade between them. Because this simply"
" animates a value it does not create a strip like other effects or "
"transitions."

"The *Cross* transition fades from one strip to another, also known as a "
"crossfade. Strips can be overlapping or have a gap between them, however,"
" when strips contain a gap the last and first frame of each strip is "
"extend which can cause a pause if any of the strips are a sequence."

"The *Gamma Cross* transition is similar to the `Cross`_ transition, "
"however, the *Gamma Cross* transition uses color correction while "
"transitioning between the two strips, resulting in a smoother transition "
"that is easier on the eyes."
