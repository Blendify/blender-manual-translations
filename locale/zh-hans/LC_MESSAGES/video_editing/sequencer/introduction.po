"The Sequencer region is horizontally divided into channels, each channel "
"can contain what is called a strip. A strip can be an image, animation, "
"or any number of effects. Each channel is numbered consecutively on the "
"Y axis, starting from zero and allows up to 32 total channels. The X "
"axis represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips as it "
"needs as long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap "
"another, it needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other "
"strip. When strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the "
"lowest channel forms the background and the highest the foreground."

"序列编辑器区域被水平划分为许多通道，每个通道可以放置片段。片段可以是一张"
"图像，一段动画，或者任意数量的效果(特效)。通道从0开始纵向连续编号，最多允"
"许使用32个通道。横轴表示时间。只要片段不重叠，每个通道可以放置所需的大量"
"片段。如果片段需要与另一片段重叠，则需要将其放置在另一片段上方或下方的通"
"道上。片段自下而上堆叠，最下方的通道作为背景，而最上方的通道则为前景。"
