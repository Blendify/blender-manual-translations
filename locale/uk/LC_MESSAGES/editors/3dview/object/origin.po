"Each object has an origin point. The location of this point determines "
"where the object is located in 3D space. When an object is selected, a "
"small circle appears, denoting the origin point. The location of the "
"origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an "
"object. See :doc:`Pivot Points "
