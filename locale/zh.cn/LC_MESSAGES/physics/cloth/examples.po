"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric. "
"So, let's delete the default cube and add a plane. I scaled mine up along "
"the Y axis, but you don't have to do this. In order to get some good floppy "
"and flexible fabric, you'll need to subdivide it several times. I did it 8 "
"times for this example. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit mode*, and press :kbd:`W` "
"--> *Subdivide multi*, and set it to 8."

"Now, we'll make this cloth by going to the *Object* context --> *Physics* "
"sub-context. Scroll down until you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the "
"*Cloth* button. Now, a lot of settings will appear, most of which we'll "
"ignore for now."

"That's all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you "
"press :kbd:`Alt-A`, your lovely fabric will just drop very un-spectacularly."
" That's what we'll cover in the next two sections about pinning and "
"colliding."

"You can *Apply* the *Cloth* modifier at any point to freeze the mesh in "

"and end frames from which to run the simulation forward."

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid shape "
"and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or so, and the"
" flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* modifier. If you"
" want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, re-enable it for the "
"frame range when it is in camera view."

"Now, if you followed this from the previous section, your cloth is probably "
"looking a little blocky. In order to make it look nice and smooth like the "
"picture you need to apply a *Smooth* and/or *Subsurf* modifier in the "
"*Modifiers* panel under the *Editing* context. Then, in the same context, "
"find the *Links and Materials* panel (the same one you used for vertex "
"groups) and press *Set Smooth*."
