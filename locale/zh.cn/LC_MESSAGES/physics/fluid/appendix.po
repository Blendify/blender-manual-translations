"Blender freezes after clicking *BAKE*. Pressing :kbd:`Esc` makes it work "

"memory is swapped to hard disk, making everything horribly slow. Reducing "

"The meshes should be closed, so if some parts of e.g. a fluid object are not"

"vertices are closed meshes. Unfortunately, the Suzanne (monkey) mesh in "
"Blender is not a closed mesh (the eyes are separate)."

"Note that first frame may well take only a few hundred MBs of RAM memory, "

"Don't be surprised, but you'll get whole bunch of mesh (.bobj.gz) files "
"after a simulation. One set for preview, and another for final. Each set has"
" a .gz file for each frame of the animation. Each file contains the "
"simulation result - so you'll need them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/fluid/appendix.rst:20
msgid ""
"Currently these files will not be automatically deleted, so it is a good "
"idea to e.g. create a dedicated directory to keep simulation results. Doing "
"a fluid simulation is similar to clicking the *ANIM* button - you currently "
"have to take care of organizing the fluid surface meshes in some directory "
"yourself. If you want to stop using the fluid simulation, you can simply "
"delete all the ``*fluid*.bobj.gz`` files."

"Fluid objects must be completely inside the bounding box of the domain "
"object. If not, baking may not work correctly or at all. Fluid and obstacle "
"objects can be meshes with complex geometries. Very thin objects might not "
"appear in the simulation, if the chosen resolution is too coarse to resolve "
"them (increasing it might solve this problem)."

"For example, to produce an animation showing two separate fluid flows while "
"keeping your domain small, render one .avi using the one flow. Then move the"
" domain and render another .avi with the other flow using an alpha channel "
"(in a separate B&W .avi?). Then, composite both .avi's using the "
"compositor's add function. A third ``.avi`` is usually the smoke and mist "
"and it is laid on top of everything as well. Add a rain sheet on top of the "
"mist and spray and you'll have quite a storm brewing! And then lightning "
"flashes, trash blowing around, all as separate animations, compositing the "
"total for a truly spectacular result."
