"Armatures mimic real skeletons. They are made out of bones, which are (by"
" default) rigid elements. But you have more possibilities than with real "
"skeletons: In addition to the \"natural\" rotation of bones, you can also"
" translate and even scale them! And your bones do not have to be "
"connected to each other; they can be completely free if you want. "
"However, the most natural and useful setups imply that some bones are "
"related to others, forming so-called \"chains of bones\", which create "
"some sort of \"limbs\" in your armature, as detailed in `Chains of "
"Bones`_."

"The bones inside an armature can be completely independent from each "
"other (i.e. the modification of one bone does not affect the others). But"
" this is not often a useful set up: To create a leg, all bones \"after\" "
"the thigh bone should move \"with\" it in a well-coordinated manner. This"
" is exactly what happens in armatures - by parenting a bone to the next "
"one in the limb, you create a \"chains of bones\". These chains can be "
"ramified. For example, five fingers attached to a single \"hand\" bone."

"Bones are chained by linking the tip of the parent to the root of the "

"object relationship."
