"Bone Groups are meant to be used during the rig creation to define and "
"assign a color to a meaningful set of bones. It is an usual convention to"
" color Left parts of the rig as blue and Right parts as red, although it "
"is not mandatory. These groups can later be easily accessed with the "
"*Select* and *Deselect* buttons. The *Assign* and *Remove* buttons serve "
"to add or remove the currently selected bones to the currently selected "
"group."
