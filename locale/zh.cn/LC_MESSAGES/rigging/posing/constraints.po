"The Constraints panel in Pose mode, with one Floor constraint applied to the"
" active bone (Bone.001)."

"As bones behave like objects in *Pose* mode, they can also be constrained. "
"This is why the *Constraints* panel is shown in both *Object* and *Editing* "
"contexts in this mode... This panel contains the constraints *of the active "
"bone* (its name is displayed at the top of the panel, in the *To Bone:...* "
"static text field)."

"Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom in their "
"pose transformations, using e.g. the *Limit* constraints. You can also use "
"constraints to make a bone track another object/bone (inside the same "
"object, or in another armature), etc. And the :doc:`inverse kinematics "
"feature </rigging/posing/inverse_kinematics>` is also mainly available "
"through the *IK Solver* constraint - which is specific to bones."

"For example, a human elbow can't rotate backward (unless the character has "
"broken his hand), nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations are "
"limited in a given range (for example, depending on the rest position of "
"your elbow, it may be from ``0`` to ``160``, OR from ``-45`` to ``135``)."

"So you should apply a *Limit Rotation* constraint to the forearm bone (as "
"the elbow movement is the result of rotating the forearm bone around its "
"root)."

"Using bones in constraints, either as owners or as targets, is discussed in "
