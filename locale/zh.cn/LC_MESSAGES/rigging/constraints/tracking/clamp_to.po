msgid "Clamp To Constraint"
msgstr "Clamp To Constraint 限制到"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:8
msgid "The *Clamp To* constraint clamps an object to a curve. The *Clamp To* constraint is very similar to the :doc:`Follow Path </rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` constraint, but instead of using the evaluation time of the target curve, *Clamp To* will get the actual location properties of its owner (those shown in the *Transform* panel), and judge where to put it by \"mapping\" this location along the target curve."
msgstr "*轴向限定(Clamp To)* 约束将一个对象限定到曲线上。*轴向限定(Clamp To)* 约束和跟随路径（ :doc:`Follow Path </rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` ）约束非常类似。但不是使用目标曲线计算时间，*轴向限定(Clamp To)* 获得其自身的实际位置属性（在 *变换* 属性面板中显示，N），并判断沿着目标曲线在哪里“映射”这个位置。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:15
msgid "One benefit is that when you are working with *Clamp To*, it is easier to see what your owner will be doing; since you are working in the 3D View, it will just be a lot more precise than sliding keys around on a F-Curve and playing the animation over and over."
msgstr "一个好处是当你正在使用Clamp，它会更容易地看到自身正在做什么; 因为你正工作在 3D 视图中，它就会比在F 曲线左右滑动键和一遍又一遍地播放动画更精确。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:20
msgid "A downside is that unlike in the :doc:`Follow Path constraint </rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path>`, *Clamp To* does not have any option to track your owner's rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) to the banking of the targeted curve, but you do not always need rotation on, so in cases like this it's usually a lot handier to fire up a *Clamp To*, and get the bits of rotation you do need some other way."
msgstr "缺点是，不像跟随路径（ :doc:`Follow Path </rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` ） *轴向限定(Clamp To)* 没有任何选项来跟踪你的自身的旋转(pitch, roll, yaw) 到目标曲线的堆积，但你不总是需要旋转，所以在这样的情况下通常是 *轴向限定(Clamp To)* 更通常很多更加得心应手，来得到你需要一些其他的方式得到的旋转。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:26
msgid "The mapping from the object's original position to its position on the curve is not perfect, but uses the following simplified algorithm:"
msgstr "从物体的原始位置到曲线上它的位置的映射不是完美的，而是使用下面的简化算法："

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:31
msgid "A \"main axis\" is chosen, either by the user, or as the longest axis of the curve's bounding box (the default)."
msgstr "选择\"主轴\"，用户或曲线的边界框的长轴（默认值）。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:32
msgid "The position of the object is compared to the bounding box of the curve in the direction of the main axis. So for example if X is the main axis, and the object is aligned with the curve bounding box's left side, the result is 0; if it is aligned with the right side, the result is 1."
msgstr "物体的位置相比曲线的边界框在主轴方向。例如，如果X是主轴，物体与曲线边界框的左边对齐，结果是0；如果它与右边对齐，结果是1。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:35
msgid "If the cyclic option is unchecked, this value is clamped in the range 0-1."
msgstr "如果未选中循环（cyclic）选项，则该值将被限定在0-1范围内。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:36
msgid "This number is used as the curve time, to find the final position along the curve that the object is clamped to."
msgstr "这个数字被用来作为曲线的时间，为物体被限定到沿曲线找到最终的位置的时间。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:38
msgid "This algorithm does not produce exactly the desired result because curve time does not map exactly to the main axis position. For example an object directly in the center of a curve will be clamped to a curve time of 0.5 regardless of the shape of the curve, because it is halfway along the curve's bounding box. However, the 0.5 curve time position can actually be anywhere within the bounding box!"
msgstr "该算法不完全产生所需的准确结果，因为曲线时间不准确地映射到主轴位置。例如一个物体直接在曲线的中心将固定到 0.5 曲线时间而不管曲线的形状，因为它是沿着曲线的边界框。然而，0.5曲线的时间位置实际上可以在任何边界框内！"

msgid "Options"
msgstr "Options 选项"

msgid "Clamp To panel."
msgstr "*轴向限定(Clamp To)* 面板。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:57
msgid "Target"
msgstr "Target 目标"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:54
msgid "The Target: field indicates which curve object the Clamp To constraint will track along. The Target: field must be a curve object type. If this :ref:`ui-data-id` field is not filled in then it will be highlighted in red indicating that this constraint does not have all the information it needs to carry out its task and will therefore be ignored on the constraint stack."
msgstr "目标（Target）：字段指示沿哪些曲线物体轴向限定约束。目标（Target）：字段必须是一个曲线物体类型。如果在这样的 :ref:`ui-data-id` 字段没有填充曲线物体，然后它会用红色高亮显示，这个约束没有它执行任务所需的所有信息，因此在约束堆栈上会被忽略。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:67
msgid "Main Axis"
msgstr "Main Axis 主轴"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:60
msgid "This button group controls which global axis (X, Y or Z) is the main direction of the path. When clamping the object to the target curve, it will not be moved significantly on this axis. It may move a small amount on that axis because of the inexact way this constraint functions."
msgstr "这个按钮组控制那一个全局轴（x，y或z）是路径的主要方向。当将物体限定到目标曲线上时，它不会在这个轴上显著移动。由于该约束功能的不精确性，它可能会在该轴上产生少量移动。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:64
msgid "For example if you are animating a rocket launch, it will be the Z axis because the main direction of the launch path is up. The default *Auto* option chooses the axis which the curve is longest in (or X if they are equal). This is usually the best option."
msgstr "例如，如果你是火箭发射动画，它将是Z轴，因为发射路径的主要方向是向上的。默认 *Auto（自动）* 选项选择的轴曲线是最长的（或X，如果它们是相等的）。这通常是最好的选择。"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:74
msgid "Cyclic"
msgstr "Cyclic 循环"

#: ../../manual/rigging/constraints/tracking/clamp_to.rst:70
msgid "By default, once the object has reached one end of its target curve, it will be constrained there. When the *Cyclic* option is enabled, as soon as it reaches one end of the curve, it is instantaneously moved to its other end. This is of course primarily designed for closed curves (circles & co), as this allows your owner to go around it over and over."
msgstr "默认情况下，一旦对象到达目标曲线的一端，它将被限制在那里。当 *Cyclic* 选项被启用时，当它到达曲线的一端，它立即移动到它的另一端。这当然是主要为封闭曲线（圆圈& CO）设计的，因为这允许你的自身一遍又一遍循环。"
