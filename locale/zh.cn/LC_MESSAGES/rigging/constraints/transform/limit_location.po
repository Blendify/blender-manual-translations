"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the "
"X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed "
"translations along each axis, through lower and upper bounds."

"对象或 *非相连的* 骨骼可以在场景沿 X、 Y 和 Z 轴移动。该约束用于通过下限"

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the "
"minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in its *Transform* panel."

"When an owner is grabbed and attempted to be moved outside the limit "
"boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when "
"rendered, but internally, its coordinates will still be changed beyond "
"the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump "
"to its internally specified location."
msgstr ""
"当拖动物体，并试图超出限定边界，视觉上以及渲染时，物体仍然被限定在边界"

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the "
"limits, dragging it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing "

"(unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."
msgstr ""
"类似地，如果约束对象的内部坐标超出范围，把它拖回到限制区域，在其内部坐标"
