"Constraints control the behavior of one object with data from another. "
"Constraints can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball "
"bouncing across the court. Constraints allow the wheels on a bus to all "
"rotate together. Constraints help a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee "
"automatically as it walks. Constraints make it easy for a hand to grip the "

"Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out. Copy Location "
"is a good first constraint to explore. Take the time to understand every "
