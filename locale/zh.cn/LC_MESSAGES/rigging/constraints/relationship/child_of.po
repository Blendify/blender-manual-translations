"Don't confuse this \"basic\" object parenting with the one that defines the "
":ref:`chains of bones <armature-bone_chain>` inside of an armature. This "
"constraint is used to parent an object to a bone (the so-called :doc:`object"
" skinning </rigging/skinning/objects>`), or even bones to bones. But don't "

"When creating a new parent relationship using this constraint, it is usually"
" necessary to click on the *Set Inverse* button after assigning the parent. "
"As noted above, this cancels out any unwanted transform from the parent, so "
"that the owner returns to the location/rotation/scale it was in before the "
"constraint was applied. Note that you should apply *Set Inverse* with all "
"other constraints disabled (their *Influence* set to **0.0**) for a "
"particular *Child Of* constraint, and before transforming the target/parent "
"(see example below)."

"About the toggle buttons that control which target's (i.e. parent's) "
"individual transform properties affect the owner, it is usually best to "
"leave them all enabled, or to disable all three of the given Location, "
"Rotation or Scale transforms."

"If you use this constraint with all channels on, it will use a straight "
"matrix multiplication for the parent relationship, not decomposing the "
"parent matrix into loc/rot/size. This ensures any transformation correctly "
"gets applied, also for combinations of rotated and non-uniform scaled "
"parents."
