"*Sculpt* Mode is similar to *Edit* Mode in that it is used to alter the "
"shape of a model, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: instead of"
" dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces), an area of "
"the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of selecting a "
"group of vertices, Sculpt Mode automatically selects vertices based on where"
" the brush is, and modifies them accordingly."
