"*Noise* is an old feature. The :doc:`Displace Modifier "
"</modeling/modifiers/deform/displace>` is a non-destructive alternative "
"to the Noise tool and is a more flexible way to realize these sort of "
"effects. The key advantages of the modifier are that it can be canceled "
"at any moment, you can precisely control how much and in which direction "
"the displacement is applied, and much more.... See also the ANT Landscape"
" :doc:`add-on </advanced/scripting/python/addons>`."
