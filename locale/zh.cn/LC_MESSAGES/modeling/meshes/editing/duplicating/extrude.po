"One tool of paramount importance for working with meshes is the *Extrude* "
"tool. It allows you to create parallelepipeds from rectangles and cylinders "
"from circles, as well as easily create such things as tree limbs. *Extrude* "
"is one of the most frequently used modeling tools in Blender. It's simple, "
"straightforward, and easy to use, yet very powerful."

"The selection is extruded along the common normal of selected faces. In "
"every other case the extrusion can be limited to a single axis by specifying"
" an axis (e.g. :kbd:`X` to limit to the X axis or :kbd:`Shift-X` to the YZ "
"plane. When extruding along the face normal, limiting movement to the global"
" Z axis requires pressing :kbd:`Z` twice, once to disable the face normal Z "
"axis limit, and once to enable the global Z axis limit."

"First, the algorithm determines the outside edge-loop of the extrude; that "

"In other cases, the selected faces are linked to the newly created faces but"

"*Extrude Individual* allows you to extrude a selection of multiple faces as "
"individuals, instead of as a region. The faces are extruded along their own "
"normals, rather than their average. This has several consequences: first, "
