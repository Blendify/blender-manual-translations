"Curve selection in *Edit* mode is much less complex than with meshes! Mainly"
" this is because you have only one selectable element type, the control "
"points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit more complex "
"than simple vertices, however, especially for Béziers, as there is the "
"central vertex, and its two handles..."

"The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes "
"</modeling/meshes/selecting/basics>`, so you can select a simple control "
"point with a :kbd:`LMB` -click, add to current selection with :kbd:`Shift-"

"One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main central "
"vertex, the two handles are automatically selected too, so you can grab it "
"as a whole, without creating an angle in the curve. However, when you select"
" a handle, only this vertex is selected, allowing you to modify this control"
" vector..."

":kbd:`L` (or :kbd:`Ctrl-L`) will add to the selection the cursor's nearest "
"control point, and all the linked ones, i.e. all points belonging to the "
"same curve. Note that for Bézier, using :kbd:`L` with a handle selected will"
