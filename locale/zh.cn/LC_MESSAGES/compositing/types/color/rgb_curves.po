"For each color component channel (RGB) or the composite (C), this node "
"allows you to define a bezier curve that varies the input (x-axis) to "
"produce an output value (y-axis). Clicking on one of the *C R G B* "

"Manually adjusting the RGB curves for color correction can be difficult. "

"In this example, the White Level is set to the color of a bright spot of the"
" sand in the background, and the Black Level to the color in the center of "
"the fish's eye. To do this efficiently it's best to bring up an image viewer"
" window showing the original input image. You can then use the levels' color"
" picker to easily choose the appropriate colors from the input image, "
"zooming in to pixel level if necessary. The result can be fine-tuned with "
"the R,G, and B curves like in the previous example."

"Note that e.g. setting Black Level to red and White Level to blue does not "
"simply substitute black with red and white with blue as the example image "
"might suggest. Levels do color scaling, not substitution, but depending on "
"the settings they can result in the described color substitution."

"(What really happens when setting Black Level to pure red and White Level to"

"Because of this the results of setting arbitrary Black/White Levels or RGB "
