msgid ""
"This node blurs individual color channels. The color channel (or a black and"
" white image) is connected to the *Mask* input socket, and the *Distance* is"
" set manually (by clicking on the arrows or the value) or automatically from"
" a value node or a time-and-map-value noodle. A positive value of *Distance*"
" expands the influence of a pixel on its surrounding pixels, thus blurring "
"that color outward. A negative value erodes its influence, thus increases "
"the constrast of that pixel relative to its surrounding pixels, thus "
"sharpening it relative to surrounding pixels of the same color."

"In this example image, we wanted to take the rather boring array of ball "
"bearings and spruce it up; make it hot, baby. So, we dilated the red and "
"eroded the green, leaving the blue alone. If we had dilated both red and "
"green...(hint: red and green make yellow). The amount of influence is "
"increased by increasing the *Distance* values. `Blend file available here. "
