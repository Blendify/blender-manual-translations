"Both material and composite nodes can be grouped. Grouping nodes can "
"simplify the node network layout in the node editor, making your material"
" or composite node setup easier to work with. Grouping nodes also creates"
" what are called NodeGroups (inside a blend-file) or NodeTrees (when "
"appending)."

msgid ""
"Conceptually, \"grouping\" allows you to specify a *set* of nodes that "
"you can treat as though it were \"just one node\". You can then re-use it"
" one or more times in this or some other blend-file(s)."

msgid ""
"As an example:  If you have created a material using nodes that you would"
" like to use in another blend-file, you could simply append the material "
"from one blend-file to another. However, what if you would like to create"
" a new material, and use a branch from an existing material node network?"
" You could re-create the branch. Or you could append the material to the "
"new blend-file, then cut and paste the branch that you want into the new "
"material. Both of these options work, but are not very efficient when "
"working across different blend-files. A better method of re-use, for "
"either material node branches or composite node networks, would be to "
"create groups of nodes."

"To create a node group, in the node editor, select the nodes you want to "
"include, then press :kbd:`Ctrl-G`, :menuselection:`Group --> Make Group`,"
" :kbd:`Shift-A`. A node group will have a green title bar. All of the "
"selected nodes will now be contained within the group node. Default "
"naming for the node group is \"NodeGroup\", \"NodeGroup.001\" etc. There "
"is a name field in the node group you can click into to change the name "
"of the group. Change the name of the node group to something meaningful. "
"When appending node groups from one blend file to another, Blender does "
"not make a distinction between material node groups or composite node "
"groups, so it is recommended some naming convention, that will allow you "
"to easily distinguish between the two types."
