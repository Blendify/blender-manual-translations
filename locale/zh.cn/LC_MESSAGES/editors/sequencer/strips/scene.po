"Scene strips are a way to insert the render output of a scene into your "
"sequence. Instead of rendering out a video, then inserting the video file, "
"you can insert the scene directly."

"This is similar to how :doc:`/editors/sequencer/strips/meta` work, with the "

"Its best not add a scene strip for the scene you're currently editing. While"

#~ "You can add the virtual image output of a Scene in your current .blend file "
#~ "as well. Select the scene from the pop-up list, and a strip will be added "
#~ "and rubberbanded to your mouse just like a movie or image. The strip length "
#~ "will be determined based on the animation settings in that scene (not the "
#~ "current scene, unless the VSE is operating in the same scene)."

#~ "When adding a Scene strip, please note that, in order to show you the strip "
#~ "in the VSE Image preview mode, Blender must render the scene. This may take "
#~ "awhile if the scene is complex, so there may be a delay between the time you"
#~ " select the scene and the time the strip appears. To reduce the delay, "
#~ "simplify the scene rendering by selecting fewer layers to render."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If the extra overhead of rendering the scene becomes burdensome (for either "
#~ "preview or for multiple test renders) and you have enough disk space "
#~ "consider rendering the scene to a sequence of PNGs and using an Image "
#~ "Sequence strip instead of a scene. This is very popular for static graphic "
#~ "overlays like title cards which are often little more than a static image "
#~ "with animated opacity."
