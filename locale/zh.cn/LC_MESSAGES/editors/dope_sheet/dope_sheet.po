"Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when each"
" drawing, sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They "
"nicknamed this the 'dopesheet'. While CG foundations dramatically differ "
"from classical hand-drawn animation, Blender's Dopesheet inherits a similar "
"directive. It gives the animator a 'birds-eye-view' of every thing occurring"
" within a scene."

"*Grease Pencil* is dedicated to the :doc:`grease pencil tool's "

"It contains the keyframes for all visible action channels. As with the other"
" \"time\" windows, the X-axis materializes the time. The Y-axis has no mean "
"in itself, unlike with the FCurve editor, it's just a sort of \"stack\" of "
"action channels - each one being shown as an horizontal colored strip (of a "
"darker shade \"during\" the animated/keyed period). On these channel strips "
"lay the keyframes, materialized as light-gray (unselected) or yellow "
"(selected) diamonds. One of the key feature of this window is that it allow "
"you to visualize immediately which channel (i.e. Ipo curve) is *really* "
"affected. When the value of a given channel does not change at all between "
"two neighboring keyframes, a gray (unselected) or yellow (selected) line is "
"drawn between them."
