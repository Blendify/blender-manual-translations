"*Duplication Faces* or *DupliFaces* is the capability to replicate an object"

"The positioning of the duplicated geometry relative to the face is dependent"
" upon the position of the child objects relative to the duplicator's origin."
" This can lead to some visual artifacts in the editor as the geometry of the"
" original objects overlaps or intersects with the duplicates. One workaround"
" is to move the origin of the duplicator mesh off of the plane of the faces."

"If the geometry of the children is not symmetrical then the orientation of "

"2.70 blender does not have tools which allow you to adjust the ordering of "
"the vertices on a face."

"However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this. Make a single "
"square and enable the Duplication / Faces so you can see the duplicated "
"geometry in your editor window. If the orientation is not what you want, "
"rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do the "
"rotation in Edit mode, not Object mode, but this is not a hard rule."

"Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the "
"duplicate where you want it. Repeat this process until you have enough "
"faces. Since it is common for these faces to butt up against one another, "
"your geometry will have lots of duplicate vertices. Use the Remove Doubles "
"button in the Tools panel."
