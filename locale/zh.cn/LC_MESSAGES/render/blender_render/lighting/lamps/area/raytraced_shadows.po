"This have the same role as with other lamps, but when using a *Rectangle* "
"*Area* lamp, you have two samples settings: *Samples X* and *Samples Y*, for"

"Jittered* sample generator method, this is more or less equivalent to the "
"number of virtual lamps in the area. With QMC sample generator methods, it "
"behaves similarly to with *Lamp* or *Spot* lamps."

"``(a)`` is the *Area* light as defined in Blender. If its shape is *Square*,"

"You will note that changing the *Size* parameter of your area lamp doesn't "
"affect the lighting intensity of your scene. On the other hand, rescaling "
"the lamp using the :kbd:`S` in the 3D View could dramatically increase or "
"decrease the lighting intensity of the scene. This behavior has been coded "
"this way so that you can fine tune all your light settings and then decide "
"to scale up (or down) the whole scene without suffering from a drastic "
"change in the lighting intensity. If you only want to change the dimensions "
"of your *Area* lamp, without messing with its lighting intensity, you are "
"strongly encouraged to use the *Size* button(s) instead."

"If your computer isn't very fast, when using the *Constant Jittered* sample "

"simulate slightly softer shadows. However, these results will never be "
"better than the same lighting with high *Samples* values."
