"The Preview panel gives a quick visualization of the active material and "
"its properties. Including its *Shaders*, *Ramps*, *Mirror Transp* "
"properties and *Textures*. It provides several shapes that are very "
"useful for designing new shaders: For some shaders (like those based on "
"*Ramp* colors, or a Diffuse shader like *Minnaert*), one needs fairly "
"complex or specific previewing shapes to decide if the shader being "
"designed achieves its goal."
