"A material defines the artistic qualities of the substance that an "
"object is made of. In its simplest form, you can use materials to show "
"the substance an object is made of, or to \"paint\" the object with "
"different colors. Usually, the substance is represented by its surface "
"qualities (color, shininess, reflectance, etc.) but it can also exhibit "
"more complicated effects such as transparency, diffraction and sub-"
"surface scattering. Typical materials might be brass, skin, glass, or "
"linen."

"材质定义了构成物体的物质的艺术特质。最简单的形式是，用材质去表现构成物体"
"的物质，或者给物体“涂上”不同的颜色。通常，使用表面品质(颜色，光泽度，反"
"射，等等)来表现物质，但是材质也可以用来展示更多的效果如透明，衍射和次表面"
"散射。典型的材质如黄铜，皮肤，玻璃或亚麻布。"

"The rendered image you create with Blender is a projection of the scene "
"onto an imaginary surface called the *viewing plane*. The viewing plane "
"is analogous to the film in a traditional camera, or the rods and cones "
"in the human eye, except that it receives simulated light, not real "
"light."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To render an image of a scene we must first determine what light from "
"the scene is arriving at each point on the viewing plane. The best way "
"to answer this question is to follow a straight line (the simulated "
"light ray) backwards through that point on the viewing plane and the "
"focal point (the location of the camera) until it hits a renderable "
"surface in the scene, at which point we can determine what light would "
"strike that point."

"Two basic types of phenomena take place at any point on a surface when a "

"Using the internal ray tracer, other (more advanced) phenomena could "

"the appearance of objects can be quite different. Also, the material "
"properties settings can be affected by the texture method used (Single "
