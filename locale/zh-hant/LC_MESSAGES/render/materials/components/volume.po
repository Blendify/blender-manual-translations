"To set up a volume, you create a mesh that defines the bounds within "

"Currently, this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as "
"the world surface shader or sun lights will have no effect if a volume "

"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it "
"is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most "
"of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "

#: ../../manual/render/materials/components/volume.rst:117
msgid ""
"Real-world effects such as scattering in clouds or subsurface scattering "
"require many scattering bounces. However, unbiased rendering of such "
"effects can be noisy, so by default the number of bounces is zero in "
"Cycles, and no support is available in Eevee. The effect you get when "
"rendering with zero volume bounces is what is known as \"single "

msgid ""
"For materials such as clouds or smoke that do not have a well defined "
