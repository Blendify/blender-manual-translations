"Like curves, surfaces can be closed (cyclical) or open, independently in "
"both directions, allowing you to easily create a tube, donut or sphere "
"shape, and they can be viewed as \"solids\" in *Edit Mode*. This makes "
"working with surfaces quite easy."

"Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <modeling-curve-knot>`, NURBS surfaces have "
"two knot vectors, one for each U and V axis. Here again, they can be one "
"of *Cyclic*, *Endpoint*, or *Bézier*, with the same properties as for "
"curves. And as with curves, only open surfaces (in the relevant "
"direction) are affected by this setting..."

"In Fig. :ref:`fig-surface-intro-endpoint` the U interpolation axis is "
"labeled as \"U\" and the V interpolation axis is labeled as \"V\". The "
"U's interpolation axis has been set to *Endpoint* and as such the surface"
" now extends to the outer edges from E1 to E2 along the U interpolation "
"axis."

"One more time, this property is the same as with :ref:`NURBS Curves "
"<modeling-curve-order>`; it specifies how much the control points are "
"taken into account for calculating the curve of the surface shape. For "
"high Orders 1 the surface pulls away from the control points, creating a "
"smoother surface by assuming that the `Resolution`_ is high enough. For "
"lowest Orders 2 the surface follows the control points, creating a "
"surface that tends to follow the grid cage."

"Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <curve-nurbs>`, *Resolution* controls the "
"detail of the surface. The higher the *Resolution* the more detailed and "
"smoother the surface is. The lower the *Resolution* the rougher the "
"surface. However, here you have two resolution settings, one for each "
"interpolation axis (U and V). Note that unlike with curves, you have only"
" one resolution (the *Resolution* U and V fields, in the *Curve Tools* "
