"The most basic element, a vertex, can be added with a left button mouse "
"click while pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` when no other vertices are selected, or "
":kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`. Because the camera space (computer screen) is two-"
"dimensional, Blender cannot determine all three vertex coordinates from a"
" single mouse click, so the new vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D "
"cursor."

msgid ""
"To create interconnected vertices, you can add a vertex and continuously "
"make subsequent :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` operations with the last one vertex "
"selected. This will link the last selected vertex with the vertex created"
" at the mouse position with an edge (See Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-basics-add-"
"one`), and will continuously connect them creating vertices if you "
"continue repeating this operation. (see Fig. 3 Creating simple connected "

"If you have two vertices selected and already connected with an edge, "

"For :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, Blender will automatically rotate the last selected "
"Edge (the source) for the subsequent operations if you have at least one "
"face created, dividing the angles created between the newly-created edge "
"and the last two edges, performing a smooth angle between them. Blender "
"will calculate this angle using the last positive and negative position "
"of the last X and Y coordinates and the last connected unselected edge. "
"If this angle exceeds a negative limit (following a quadrant rule) "
"between the recently created edge and the last two, Blender will wrap the"
" faces. But if you do not want Blender rotating and smoothing edges "
"automatically when extruding from :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you can also inhibit "
"Blender from rotating sources using the shortcut :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-LMB`. "
"In this case, Blender will not rotate the source dividing the angle "
"between those edges when creating a face."
