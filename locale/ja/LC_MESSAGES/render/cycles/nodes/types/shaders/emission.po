"for example, be used for material and lamp surface outputs."

"Cycles uses a physically correct light falloff by default, whereas "
"Blender Internal uses a smoothed falloff with a Distance parameter. A "
"similar effect can be found by using the Light Falloff node with the "
"Smooth parameter."

"Lamp strength for point, spot and area lamps is specified in Watts. This "
"means you typically need higher values than Blender Internal, as you "
"could not use a 1W lamp to light a room; you need something stronger like"
" a 100W lamp."

"Sun lamps are specified in Watts/m\\ :sup:`2`\\, which require much "
"smaller values like 1 W/m\\ :sup:`2`\\. This can be confusing, but "
"specifying strength in Watts would not have been convenient; the real sun"
" for example has strength 384.6×10\\ :sup:`24`\\W. Emission shaders on "
"meshes are also in Watts/m\\ :sup:`2`\\."
