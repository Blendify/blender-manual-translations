"At first a Physics type that makes the particles do nothing could seem a "
"bit strange, but it can be very useful at times. None physics make the "
"particles stick to their emitter their whole life time. The initial "
"velocities here are for example used to give a velocity to particles that"
" are affected by a harmonic effector with this physics type when the "
"effect of the effector ends."
