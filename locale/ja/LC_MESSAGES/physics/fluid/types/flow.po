"Any fluid that enters the region of this object will be deleted (think of"
" a drain or a black hole). This can be useful in combination with an "
"inflow to prevent the whole domain from filling up. When enabled, this is"
" like a tornado (waterspout) or \"wet vac\" vacuum cleaner, and the part "
"where the fluid disappears will follow the object as it moves around."
