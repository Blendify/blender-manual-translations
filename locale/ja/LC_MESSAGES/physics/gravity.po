"Gravity is a global setting that is applied to all physics systems in a "
"scene. It can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally fine "
"left at its default, -9.810 on the Z-Axis, which is the force of gravity "
"in the real world. Changing this value would simulate a lower or higher "
"force of gravity. Gravity denoted g, measurement *m* × *s*\\ :sup:`-2`."
