"Masks can be created in the UV/Image and Movie Clip editors, by changing "
"the mode to Mask in the header. This will add various tools and "
"properties to the editor panels, while hiding others that are not needed "
"for interacting with masks."

"Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow "
"to mask out, or influence a particular object in the footage. They can be"
" used for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the "
"footage, or as a rough matte for green-screen keying. Masks are "
"independent from a particular image of movie clip, and so they can just "
"as well be used for creating motion graphics or other effects in the "
"compositor."

"Masks can be driven over the time so that they follow some object from "
"the footage, e.g. a running actor. This can be achieved with shape keys "
