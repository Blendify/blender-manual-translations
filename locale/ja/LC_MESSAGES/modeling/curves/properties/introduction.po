"You can also reset it to its default value (i.e. perpendicular to the "
"original curve plane) with :kbd:`Alt-T`, :menuselection:`Curve --> "
"Control Points --> Clear Tilt`. With NURBS, the tilt is always smoothly "
"interpolated. However, with BÃ©zier, you can choose the interpolation "
"algorithm between Linear, Ease, B-Spline, and Cardinal, in the "
":menuselection:`Properties Editor --> Object Data --> Active Spline --> "
