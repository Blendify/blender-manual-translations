"Once the owner object has had a Damped Track constraint applied to it, "
"you must then choose which axis of the object you want to point at the "
"Target object. You can choose between 6 axis directions (-X, -Y, -Z, X, "
"Y, Z). The negative axis direction cause the object to point away from "
"the Target object along the selected axis direction."
