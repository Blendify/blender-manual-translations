"Tracks are the layering system of the NLA. At its most basic level, it "
"can help organize strips. But it also layers motion much like an image "
"editor layers pixels -- the bottom layer first, to the top, last."

msgid ""
"When creating a new action, if the existing action only has a single user"

"stack. Action Stashing should prevent most cases actions getting lost."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/nla/tracks.rst:72
msgid ""
"The action \"stashing\" method works by storing otherwise unused/dormant "
"actions in the NLA stack as strips in special muted NLA tracks. This way,"
" the action is linked up to a particular data-block (i.e. to a specific "
"object, or to a specific material/light/etc.) and will be preserved for "

"Also, note that since these are NLA strips, you can reuse these as normal"
" NLA strips simply by un-muting (and renaming) the NLA track they live "
"in. You may also want to move it above all the other stashed-action "
