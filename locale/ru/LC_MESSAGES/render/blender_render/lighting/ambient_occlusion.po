"Ambient Occlusion is a sophisticated ray-tracing calculation which "
"simulates soft global illumination shadows by faking darkness perceived "
"in corners and at mesh intersections, creases, and cracks, where ambient "
"light is occluded, or blocked."

"There is no such thing as AO in real life; AO is a specific not-"
"physically-accurate (but generally nice-looking) rendering trick. It "
"basically samples a hemisphere around each point on the face, sees what "
"proportion of that hemisphere is occluded by other geometry, and shades "
"the pixel accordingly."

"It's got nothing to do with light at all; it's purely a rendering trick "
"that tends to look nice because generally in real life surfaces that are "
"close together (like small cracks) will be darker than surfaces that "
"don't have anything in front of them, because of shadows, dirt, etc."

"The AO process, though, approximates this result; it's not simulating "
"light bouncing around or going through things. That's why AO still works "
"when you don't have any lights in the scene, and it's why just switching "
"on AO alone is a very bad way of \"lighting\" a scene."
