#~ "A reason for applying gamma correction"
#~ " to the final render is to "
#~ "correct lighting issues. Lighting issues "
#~ "that can be corrected by a gamma"
#~ " correction node are light attenuation "
#~ "with distance, light falloff at "
#~ "terminators, and light and shadow "
#~ "superpositions. Simply think about the "
#~ "renderer as a virtual camera. By "
#~ "applying a gamma correction to your "
#~ "render, you are just replicating what"
#~ " digital camera do with photos. "
#~ "Digital cameras gamma correct their "
#~ "photos, so you do the same thing."
#~ " The gamma correction is, indeed, "
#~ "0.45, not 2.2."

#~ "But reverse gamma correction on textures"
#~ " and colors have another very "
#~ "important consequence when you are using"
#~ " rendering techniques such as radiosity "
#~ "or global illumination (GI). When doing"
#~ " the GI calculations, all textures "
#~ "and colors are taken to mean "
#~ "reflectance. If you do not reverse "
#~ "gamma correct your textures and colors,"
#~ " then the GI render will look "
#~ "way too bright because the reflected "
#~ "colors are all way too high and"
#~ " thus a lot more light is "
#~ "bouncing around than it should."

#~ "Gamma correction in Blender enters in"
#~ " a few places. The first is in"
#~ " this section with the nodes, both"
#~ " this node and the Tonemap node, "
#~ "and the second is in calculating "
#~ "Radiosity. In the noodle to the "
#~ "left, the split viewer shows the "
#~ "before and after effect of applying "
#~ "a gamma correction."
