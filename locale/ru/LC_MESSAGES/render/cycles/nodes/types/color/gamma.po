"A reason for applying gamma correction to the final render is to correct "
"lighting issues. Lighting issues that can be corrected by a gamma "
"correction node are light attenuation with distance, light falloff at "
"terminators, and light and shadow superpositions. Simply think about the "
"renderer as a virtual camera. By applying a gamma correction to your "
"render, you are just replicating what digital camera do with photos. "
"Digital cameras gamma correct their photos, so you do the same thing. The"
" gamma correction is, indeed, 0.45, not 2.2."

"But reverse gamma correction on textures and colors have another very "
"important consequence when you are using rendering techniques such as "
"radiosity or GI. When doing the GI calculations, all textures and colors "
"are taken to mean reflectance. If you do not reverse gamma correct your "
"textures and colors, then the GI render will look way too bright because "
"the reflected colors are all way too high and thus a lot more light is "
"bouncing around than it should."

"Gamma correction in Blender enters in a few places. The first is in this "
"section with the nodes, both this node and the Tonemap node, and the "
"second is in calculating Radiosity. In the noodle to the left, the split "
"viewer shows the before and after effect of applying a gamma correction."
