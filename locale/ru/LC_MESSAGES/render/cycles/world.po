msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:18
msgid ""
"The surface shader defines the light emission from the environment into "
"the scene. The world surface is rendered as if it is very distant from "
"the scene, and as such there is no two-way interacting between objects in"
" the scene and the environment, only light coming in. The only shader "
"accepted is the Background node with a color input and strength factor "
"for the intensity of the light."

msgid "Image Based Lighting"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:28
msgid ""
"For image based lighting, use the Environment Texture node rather than "
"the Image Texture node for correct mapping. This supports Equirectangular"
" (also known as Lat/Long) for environment maps, and Mirror Ball mapping "
"for converting photos of mirror balls to environment maps."

"A volume shader can be applied to the entirely world, filling the entire "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:39
msgid ""
"Currently this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as the"
" world surface shader or sun lamps will have no effect if a volume shader"
" is used. This is because the world background is assumed to be "
"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it is"
" not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most of"
" the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "
"absorbed."

msgid "Ambient Occlusion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:53
msgid ""
"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "
"surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. This is a trick that is not "
"physically accurate, but it is useful to emphasize shapes of surfaces, or"
" as a cheap way to get an effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

msgid ""
"Lighting from ambient occlusion is only applied to diffuse reflection "
"BSDFs; glossy or transmission BSDFs are not affected. Transparency of "
"surfaces will be taken into account, i.e. a half-transparent surface will"
" only half occlude."

"An alternative method of using Ambient Occlusion on a per-shader basis is"

"Enabling this will sample the background texture such that lighter parts "
"are favored, producing less noise in the render. It is almost always a "
"good idea to enable this when using an image texture to light the scene, "

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:128
msgid ""
"Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is "
"directly visible versus one that is indirectly lighting the objects. A "
"simple solution to this is to add a Mix node, with the Blend Factor set "
"to Is Camera Ray. The first input color is then the indirect color, and "
"the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a high-"
"res image for the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:134
msgid ""
"Similarly, adding the *Is Camera* and *Is Glossy* rays will mean that the"
" high-res image will also be visible in reflections."
