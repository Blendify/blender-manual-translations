#~ msgid "Refraction"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Refraction is faked by sampling the "
#~ "same reflection probe used by the "
#~ "Glossy BSDFs, but using the refracted"
#~ " view direction instead of the "
#~ "reflected view direction. Only the first"
#~ " refraction event is modeled correctly. "
#~ "An approximation of the second "
#~ "refraction event can be used for "
#~ "relatively thin objects using Refraction "
#~ "Depth. Using Screen Space refraction "
#~ "will refract what is visible in."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Bump"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As of now, Bump mapping is "
#~ "supported using OpenGL derivatives which "
#~ "are the same for each block of "
#~ "2x2 pixels. This means the bump "
#~ "output value will appear pixelated. It"
#~ " is recommended to use Normal mapping"
#~ " instead."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If you absolutely need to render "
#~ "using Bump nodes, render at twice "
#~ "the target resolution and downscale the"
#~ " final output."

#~ msgid "Volumes Objects"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Object volume shaders will affect the"
#~ " whole bounding box of the object."
#~ " The shape of the volume must "
#~ "be adjusted using procedural texturing "
#~ "inside the shader."
