"Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated "
"vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned "
"vertex). *Weight Painting* is a method to maintain large amounts of weight "
"information in a very intuitive way. It is primarily used for rigging "
"meshes, where the vertex groups are used to define the relative bone "
"influences on the mesh. But we use it also for controlling particle "
"emission, hair density, many modifiers, shape keys, etc."

"This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, vertices"
" around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to mimic the "
"stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight (10-40%) "
"paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a little when the "
"bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically assign weights to an "
"armature (see the :doc:`Armature section </rigging/index>`), you can do this"
" manually. To do this from scratch, refer to the process below. To modify "
