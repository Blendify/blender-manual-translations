"It is possible to set a :doc:`grease pencil "
"</interface/grease_pencil/introduction>` block to be loaded up in the "
"*DopeSheet* for editing of the timings of the drawings. This is "
"especially useful for animators blocking out shots, where the ability to "
"re-time blocking is one of the main purposes of the whole exercise."

"In a *Dope Sheet* editor, change the mode selector (found beside the "
"menus) to *Grease Pencil* (by default, it should be set to *DopeSheet*)."

"At this point, the *DopeSheet* should now display a few \"channels\" with"
" some \"keyframes\" on them. These \"channels\" are the layers, and the "
"\"keyframes\" are the frames at which the layer has a sketch defined. "
"They can be manipulated like any other data in the *DopeSheet* can be."

"All the available Grease-Pencil blocks for the current screen layout will"
" be shown. The Area/Grease-Pencil data-blocks are drawn as green "
"channels, and are named with relevant info from the views. They are also "
"labeled with the area (i.e. \"window\") index (which is currently not "
"shown anywhere else though)."

msgid ""
"It is possible to copy sketches from a layer/layers to other layers in "
"the *Action Editor*, using the \"Copy\"/\"Paste\" buttons in the header. "
"This works in a similar way as the copy/paste tools for keyframes in the "
"*Action Editor*."

msgid ""
"Sketches can also be copied from one screen (or view) to another using "
"these tools. It is important to keep in mind that keyframes will only be "
"pasted into selected layers, so layers will need to be created for the "
"destination areas too."
