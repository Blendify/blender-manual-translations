"In Blender *Actions* are a generic containers for F-Curves. Actions can "
"contain any number of F-Curves, and can be attached to any data block. As"
" long as the RNA data paths stored in the Action's F-Curves can be found "
"on that data block, the animation will work. For example, an action "
"modifying *X location* and *Y location* properties can be shared across "
"multiple objects, since both objects have *X location* and *Y location* "
"properties beneath them."

"The *Action Editor* enables you to see and edit the F-Curve data-blocks "
"you defined as actions in the *F-Curve Editor*. So it takes place "
"somewhere in-between the low-level :doc:`F-Curves "
"</editors/graph_editor/introduction>`, and the high-level :doc:`NLA "
"editor </editors/nla>`. Hence, you do not have to use them for simple "
"F-Curve animations -- and they have not much interest in themselves, so "
"you will mostly use this editor when you do :doc:`NLA animation "
"</editors/nla>` (they do have a few specific usages on their own, though,"
" like e.g. with the :doc:`Action constraint "
"</rigging/constraints/relationship/action>`, or the :doc:`pose libraries "
"</rigging/posing/pose_library>`)."

"This is not a mandatory editor, as you do can edit the actions used by "

"However, it gives you a slightly simplified view of your F-Curve data-"
"blocks (somewhat similar to the \"key\" mode of the F-Curve, even though "
"more powerful in some ways) -- and, more interesting, it can show you all"
" \"action\" F-Curve data-blocks of a same object at once."

"Each \"action\" F-Curve data-block forms a top-level channel (see below)."

"As everything else in Blender, actions are data-blocks. Unlike F-Curve "
"ones, there is only one type of action, which can regroup all F-Curve of "
"a given object. You will find its usual data-block menu in the *Action "
"Editor* header."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, there is one specificity with action data-blocks: they have by "
"default a \"fake user\", i.e. once created, they are always kept in the "
"blend-file, even if no object uses them. This is due to the fact that "
"actions are designed to be used in the NLA, where you can affect several "
"different actions to a same object! Yes, this is the only way to use "
"different actions (and hence, different F-Curve data-blocks of the same "
"kind) to animate a same object. But as you have to assign an action to an"
" object to be able to edit it (and an object can only have one action "
"data-block at a time), to have \"fake users\" guaranties you that you "
"will not lose your precious previously-edited actions when you start "
"working on a new one!"

"This editor shows, by default, the action data-block linked to the "
"current active object. However, as with FCurvs, you can pin an *Action "
"Editor* to a given action with the small \"pin\" button to the left of "
"the data-block controls, in the header. This will force the editor to "
"always display this data-block, whatever the current selected object is."
