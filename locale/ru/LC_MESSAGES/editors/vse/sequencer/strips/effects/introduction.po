"Blender offers a set of effects that can be added to your sequence. Each "
"effect is explained in the next pages individually, but they all are "
"added and controlled in the same way."

"To add an effect strip, select one base strip (image, movie, or scene) by"
" :kbd:`RMB` clicking on it. For some effects, like the Cross transition "
"effect, you will need to :kbd:`Shift-RMB` a second overlapping strip (it "
"depends on the effect you want). Then select :menuselection:`Add --> "
"Effect` and pick the effect you want from the pop-up menu. When you do, "
"the Effect strip will be shown above the source strips. If it is an "
"independent effect, like the :doc:`Color Generator "
"</editors/vse/sequencer/strips/effects/color>`, it will be placed at the "
"position of the frame indicator."

"Since most Effects strips depend on one or two source strips, their frame"
" location and duration depends on their source strips. Thus, you may not "
"be able to move it; you have to move the source strips in order to affect"
" the effect strip."

"To use an effect that combines or makes a transitions select two strips, "
"When you add the effect strip, it will be placed in a channel above the "
"two. Its duration will be the overlap between the two strips as a "
"maximum."

"With some effects, like the :doc:`Alpha Over "
"</editors/vse/sequencer/strips/effects/alpha_over_under_overdrop>`, the "
"order in which you select the strips is important. You can also use one "
"effect strip as the input or source strip with another strip, thus "
"layering effects on top of one another."

"The only exception is the :doc:`Color Generator "
