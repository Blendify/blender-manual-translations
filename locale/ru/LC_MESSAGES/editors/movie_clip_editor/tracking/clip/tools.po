"Places a new marker at the position of the mouse (which is under the "
"button in this case, not ideal but it is just how things work) and then "
"it can be moved to the needed location. When it is moved to the desired "
"position, :kbd:`LMB` can be used to finish placing the new marker. Also, "
":kbd:`Return` and :kbd:`Spacebar` can be used to finish placing the "
"marker. But it is faster to use :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` to place markers directly"
" on the footage. This shortcut will place the marker in the place you "
"have clicked. One more feature here: until you have released the mouse "
"button, you can adjust the marker position by moving the mouse and using "
"the track preview widget to control how accurately the marker is placed."
