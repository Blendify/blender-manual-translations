"The graph or curves view has numerous purposes based on the color of the "
"lines. The red and green lines on the graph show you the speed of the "
"trackers at a given frame. Green is vertical movement, Red is horizontal."
" Therefore the first frames will always be at zero. The blue line is the "
"line that comes out when you click on the film strip is the average per "
"frame error. This curve is available only after pressing camera solve and"
" is not editable. This is the one line that you want to be as flat as "
"possible and as closer to zero as you can. The high points will show you "
"where in your shot you are having inaccurate tracking."

"The curves are useful to see if particular trackers are moving "
"differently than the average. A line that spikes from the rest of the "
"curve usually means a tracking error."

"You can manually edit the curve by selecting a point in the curve and "
"dragging it or deleting, that will affect the corresponding tracker on "
"that particular frame."
