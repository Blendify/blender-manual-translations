"This node puts out an RGBA image, in the format selected, for each frame "
"range specified, to the filename entered, as part of a frameset sequence. "
"This means that the name of the file will be the name you enter plus a "
"numeric frame number, plus the filename extension (based on format). Based "
"on the format you choose, various quality/compression options may be shown."

"The image is saved whenever Blender feels like it. Just kidding; whenever "

" frame) is saved."

"This node saves you from doing (or forgetting to do) the Save Image after a "
"render; the image is saved automagically for you. In addition, since this "
"node can be hooked in anywhere in the noodle, you can save intermediate "
"images automatically. Neat, huh?"
