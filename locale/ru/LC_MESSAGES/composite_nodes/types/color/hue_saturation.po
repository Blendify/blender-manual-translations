"As an alternative to RGB editing, color can be thought of as a mix of Hues, "
"namely a normalized value along the visible spectrum from infra-red to "
"ultraviolet (the rainbow, remember \"Roy G. Biv\"). The amount of the color "
"added depends on the saturation of that color; the higher the saturation, "
"the more of that pigment is added. Use the saturation slider of this node to"
" \"bring out\" the colors of a washed-out image."

"The **Hue** slider specifies how much to shift the hue of the image. Hue 0.5"
" (in the middle) does not shift the hue or affect the color of the image. As"
" Hue shifts left, the colors shift as more cyan is added; a blue image goes "
"bluer, then greener, then yellow. A red image goes violet, then purple, "
"blue, and finally teal. Shifting right (increasing Hue from 0.5 to 1.0) "
"introduces reds and greens. A blue image goes purple, plum, red, orange, and"
" then yellow. A red image goes golden, olive, green, and cyan."
