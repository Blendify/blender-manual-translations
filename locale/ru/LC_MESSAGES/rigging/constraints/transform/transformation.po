"This constraint is more complex and versatile than the other "
"\"transform\" constraints. It allows you to map one type of transform "
"properties (i.e. location, rotation or scale) of the target, to the same "
"or another type of transform properties of the owner, within a given "
"range of values (which might be different for each target and owner "
"property). You can also switch between axes, and use the range values not"
" as limits, but rather as \"markers\" to define a mapping between input "
"(target) and output (owner) values."

"So, e.g. you can use the position of the target along the X axis to "
"control the rotation of the owner around the Z-Axis, stating that 1 BU "
"along the target X-Axis corresponds to10 BU around the owner Z-Axis. "
"Typical uses for this include gears (see note below), and rotation based "
"on location setups."
