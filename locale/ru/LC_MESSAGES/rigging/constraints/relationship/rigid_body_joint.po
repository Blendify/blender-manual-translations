"The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special, it is used by the "
"physics part of the Blender Game Engine to simulate a joint between its "
"owner and its target. It offers four joint types: hinge type, ball-and-"
"socket type, cone-twist type, and generic six-DoF (degrees of freedom) "
"type."
