"Rigging makes animation possible. Without a good rig animation is "
"incredibly frustrating. Imagine animating a bouncing ball without the "
"ability to squash it against the ground? Try animating a monkey swinging "
"through the trees with no control to make the monkey's hands grab onto "
"the branches. What if you had to animate an army tank speeding through "
"the desert by positioning each tread on the tank one at a time?"

"At its most basic level, rigging solves motion problems. Imagine a door "
"that opens into a hallway. Without a rig, the door will not swing open "
"properly (1). A rig is needed to help the door swing open on its hinges "
"(2, 3, 4), and there are many ways to rig the door. Door 2 gets rigged by"
" repositioning the :term:`Object Origin` of the door. Door 3 gets rigged "
"by :term:`Parenting` the door to an :term:`Empty`. Door 4 gets rigged by "
":term:`Weight Painting` all of its :term:`Vertices` to a :term:`Bone` in "
"an :term:`Armature`."

"Most production rigs are more complicated than a simple door, but be "
"careful not to rush off building complicated rigs until you have "
"developed some experience. Rigging is a discipline that takes practice. "
"Start by building simple rigs (like a bouncing ball, a tumbling box, an "
"odometer, a clock). Stay humble. Stay patient. Study the fundamental "
"concepts that make a bouncing ball bounce. Add one rigging tool to your "
"toolbox at a time. Test your simple rigs in actual animation projects. "
"And only after much trial and error, consider putting everything together"
" into the sophisticated character rig of your dreams."

"The content of this chapter is simply a reference to how rigging is "
"accomplished in Blender. It should be paired with additional resources "
"such as Nathan Vegdahl's excellent (and free!) introduction to the "
"fundamental concepts of character rigging, `Humane Rigging "
