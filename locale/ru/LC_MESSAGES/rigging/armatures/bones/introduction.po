#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Even though bones are rigid (i.e. "

#~ " small, rigid linked elements that "
#~ "can rotate between each other. By "
#~ "default, each new bone has only "
#~ "one segment and as such it cannot"
#~ " \"bend\" along its length. It is "
#~ "a rigid bone."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "You can see these segments in "
#~ "*Object Mode* and in *Pose Mode*, "
#~ "and only if bones are visualized "
#~ "as *B-bones*; while in *Edit Mode* "

#~ "sticks. Note that in the special "
#~ "case of a single bone, you cannot"
#~ " see these segments in *Object Mode*,"

#~ "When you connect bones to form a"
#~ " :ref:`chain <armature-bone-chain>`, "
#~ "Blender calculates a Bézier curve "
#~ "passing through all the bones' ends, "
#~ "and bones' segments in the chain "
#~ "will bend and roll to follow this"
#~ " invisible curve."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "There is no direct access to the"
#~ " curve. It can only be controlled "
#~ "by some extent using bone properties,"
#~ " as explained in the :ref:`editing "
#~ "pages <armature-bone-rigid>`."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "In Fig. :ref:`fig-rig-bone-intro-"
#~ "bbone` we connected three bones, each"
#~ " one made of five segments. These "
#~ "are *B-bones* but as you see, in"
#~ " *Edit Mode* they are shown as "
#~ "rigid elements. Look at Fig. :ref"
#~ ":`fig-rig-bone-intro-same`, we can"
#~ " see how the bones' segments smoothly"
#~ " \"blend\" into each other, even for"
#~ " roll."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Of course, a geometry influenced by "
#~ "the chain is smoothly deformed according"
#~ " to the Bézier curve! In fact, "
#~ "smooth bones are an easy way to"
#~ " replace long chains of many small"
#~ " rigid bones posed using IK..."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "However, if the chain has an "
#~ "influence on objects rather than "
#~ "geometry, the segments' orientation is "

#~ "</rigging/skinning/index>`)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When not visualized as *B-Bone* s, "

#~ " are still present and effective (see"
#~ " :doc:`skinning to Object Data "
#~ "</rigging/skinning/obdata>`)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This means that even in e.g. "
#~ "*Octahedron* visualization, if some bones "
#~ "in a chain have several segments, "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Bones Influence"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "A bone in Envelope visualization, in Edit Mode."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Basically, a bone controls a geometry"
#~ " when vertices \"follow\" the bone. "
#~ "This is like how the muscles and"
#~ " skin of your finger follow your "
#~ "finger-bone when you move a "
#~ "finger."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "To do this, you have to define "
#~ "the strength of *influences* a bone "
#~ "has on a certain vertex."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The simplest way is to have each"
#~ " bone affecting those parts of the"
#~ " geometry that are within a given "
#~ "range from it. This is called the"
#~ " *envelope technique*, because each bone"
#~ " can control only the geometry "
#~ "\"enveloped\" by its own influence area."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If a bone is visualized as "
#~ "*Envelope*, in *Edit Mode* and in "
#~ "*Pose Mode* you can see the area"
#~ " of influence, which depends on:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "The *distance* property and"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "the root's radius and the tip's radius."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Our armature in Envelope visualization, in Pose Mode."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "All these influence parameters are "
#~ "further detailed in the :doc:`skinning "
