"As bones behave like objects in *Pose Mode*, they can also be "
"constrained. This is why the *Constraints* tab is shown in both *Object "
"Mode* and *Edit Mode*. This panel contains the constraints *of the active"
" bone* (its name is displayed at the top of the panel, in the *To "
"Bone:...* static text field)."

"Constraining bones can be used to control their degree of freedom in "
"their pose transformations, using e.g. the *Limit* constraints. You can "
"also use constraints to make a bone track another object/bone (inside the"
" same object, or in another armature), etc. And the :ref:`inverse "
"kinematics feature <bone-constraints-inverse-kinematics>` is also mainly "
"available through the *IK Solver* constraint, which is specific to bones."

"For example, a human elbow cannot rotate backward (unless the character "
"has broken his arm), nor to the sides, and its forward and roll rotations"
" are limited in a given range. (e.g. depending on the rest position of "
"your elbow, it may be from (0 to 160) or from (-45 to 135))."

"So you should apply a *Limit Rotation* constraint to the forearm bone (as"
" the elbow movement is the result of rotating the forearm bone around its"
" root)."
