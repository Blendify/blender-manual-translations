#~ msgid ""

#~ "little, to mimic the stretching of "

#~ " \"light\" weight (10 - 40%) paint"
#~ " on the vertices around the joint "
#~ "so that they move a little when"
#~ " the bone rotates. While there are"
#~ " ways to automatically assign weights "
#~ "to an armature (see the :doc:`Armature"
#~ " section </rigging/index>`), you can do "
#~ "this manually. To do this from "
#~ "scratch, refer to the process below. "

#~ "jump into the middle of the "
#~ "process where noted:"
