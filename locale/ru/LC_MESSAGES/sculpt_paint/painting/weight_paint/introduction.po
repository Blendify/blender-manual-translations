"Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated "
"vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned "
"vertex). *Weight Painting* is a method to maintain large amounts of "
"weight information in a very intuitive way."

"This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, "
"vertices around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to "
"mimic the stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight"
" (10 - 40%) paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a "
"little when the bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically "
"assign weights to an armature (see the :doc:`Armature section "
"</rigging/index>`), you can do this manually. To do this from scratch, "
"refer to the process below. To modify automatically assigned weights, "
