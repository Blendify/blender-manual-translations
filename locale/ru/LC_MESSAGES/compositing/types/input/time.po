#~ "The *Start* and *End* NumButtons specify"

#~ "and hence the factor that is "
#~ "output. In the example to the "
#~ "right, since the time span is 250"
#~ " frames and the line is straight "
#~ "from corner to corner, 0.50 would "

#~ "You can reverse time (unfortunately, "

#~ "frame greater than the End frame. "
#~ "The net effect of doing so is "
#~ "to flip the curve around. Warning: "
#~ "doing so is easily overlooked in "
#~ "your node map and can be very "

#~ "animation settings (:ref:`Render Dimensions "
#~ "Panel <render_output-dimensions>`). Common "
#~ "settings range from 5 seconds per "

#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "As your imagination runs wild, consider"
#~ " a few ideas that came to me"
#~ " just now on my couch: mixing a"
#~ " clouds texture with a time input "
#~ "to fog up a piece of glass "
#~ "or show spray paint building up on"
#~ " a wall. Consider mixing red and "
#~ "the soften with time (decreasing output)"
#~ " to show what someone sees when "
#~ "waking up from a hard hit on "
#~ "the head. Mix HSV input with a "
#~ "starfield image with time (decreasing "
#~ "output) to show what we might see"
#~ " someday as we accelerate our "
#~ "starship and experience red-shift."
