"In the real world, all camera lenses produce some or the other sort of "
"lens distortion. But, whatever we render has got no distortion. So, this "
"node helps in removing distortion from movies or adding distortion to "
"render to make our render blend in with the movie clip."

"Before using this node, one has to calculate the lens distortion of the "
