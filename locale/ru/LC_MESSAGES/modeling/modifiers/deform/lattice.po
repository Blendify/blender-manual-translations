msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:31
msgid ""
"A lattice consists of a three-dimensional non-renderable grid of vertices. "
"Its main use is to give extra deformation capabilities to the underlying "
"object it controls (either *via* a modifier, or as its parent). Objects to "
"be deformed can be meshes, curves, surfaces, text, lattices and even "
"particles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:36
msgid ""
"The lattice should be scaled and moved to fit around your object in object "
"mode. Any scaling applied to the object in edit mode will result in the "
"object deforming. This includes applying scale with :kbd:`Ctrl-A` as this "
"will achieve the same result as scaling the lattice in edit mode, and "
"therefore the object."

msgid ""
"A Lattice Modifier can quickly be added to selected objects by selecting "
"them all, then selecting the lattice object last and pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-P` "
"and choosing *Lattice Deform*. This will both add Lattice modifiers to the "
"selected objects and parent them to the lattice."

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:52
msgid ""
"Why would you use a lattice to deform a mesh instead of deforming the mesh "
"itself in Edit Mode ? There are a couple of reasons for that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:55
msgid ""
"If your object has a large number of vertices, it would be difficult to edit"
" portions of it quickly in Edit Mode. Using a lattice will allow you to "
"deform large portions efficiently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:57
msgid ""
"The smooth deformation you get from a lattice modifier can be hard to "
"achieve manually in Edit Mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:58
msgid ""
"Multiple objects can use the same lattice, thus allowing you to edit "
"multiple objects at once."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:59
msgid ""
"Like all modifiers, it is non-destructive. Meaning all changes happen on top"
" of the original geometry, which you can still go back and edit without "
"affecting the deformation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/lattice.rst:61
msgid "A lattice does not affect the texture coordinates of a mesh's surface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using a lattice to deform particles, always remember to place the "
"Lattice Modifier after the Particle System Modifier. Read more about the "
"importance of the modifier stack :doc:`here "
"</modeling/modifiers/the_stack>`."
