"*Curve Deform* provides a simple but efficient method of defining a "
"deformation on a mesh. By parenting a mesh object to a curve, you can "
"deform the mesh up or down the curve by moving the mesh along, or "
"orthogonal to, the dominant axis. This is a most useful tool to make an "
"object follow a complex path, like e.g. a sheet of paper inside a "
"printer, a film inside a camera, the water of a canal..."

msgid ""
"The *Curve Deform* works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This "
"means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction, the mesh "
"will traverse along the curve. Moving the mesh in an orthogonal direction"
" will move the mesh object closer or further away from the curve. The "
"default settings in Blender map the Y axis to the dominant axis. When you"
" move the object beyond the curve endings the object will continue to "
"deform based on the direction vector of the curve endings."

"If the \"curve path\" is *3D*, the *Tilt* value of its control points "
"will be used (see the :doc:`Extrusion </modeling/curves/editing/extrude>`"
" section above) to twist the \"curved\" object around it. Unfortunately, "
"the other *Radius* property is not used (it would have been possible, for"
" example, to make it control the size of the \"curved\" object...)."
