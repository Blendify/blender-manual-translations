"One of the major differences between Bézier Objects and NURBS Objects is "
"that Bézier Curves are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an"
" *approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* "
"circle. NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an "
"introduction, please consult the `Wikipedia page. "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__ In practice, many of the Bézier "
"curve operations discussed above apply to NURBS curves in the same "
"manner. The following text will concentrate only on those aspects that "
"are unique to NURBS curves."
