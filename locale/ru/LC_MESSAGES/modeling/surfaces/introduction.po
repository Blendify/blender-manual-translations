"Curves are 2D objects, and surfaces are their 3D extension. Note however,"
" that in Blender, you only have NURBS surfaces, no Bézier (you have the "
"*Bézier* knot type, though; see below), nor polygonal (but for these, you"
" have meshes!). Even though curves and surfaces share the same object "
"type (with texts also...), they are not the same thing; for example, you "
"cannot have in the same object both curves and surfaces."

"As surfaces are 2D, they have two interpolation axes, U (as for curves) "
"and V. It is important to understand that you can control the "
"interpolation rules (knot, order, resolution) *independently* for each of"
" these two dimensions (the U and V fields for all these settings, of "

"You may ask yourself \"but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only "
"2D?\". In order to be 3D, the object needs to have \"Volume,\" and a "
"surface, even when it is closed, does not have volume; it is infinitely "
"thin. If it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third "
"dimension). Hence, it is only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation"
" dimensions or axes or coordinates (if you know a bit of math, think of "
"non-euclidean geometry -- well, surfaces are just non-euclidean 2D "
"planes...). To take a more \"real life\" example, you can roll a sheet of"
" paper to create a cylinder; well, even if it \"draws\" a volume, the "
"sheet itself will remain a (nearly...) 2D object!"
