"Mesh analysis is useful for displaying attributes of the mesh that may "
"impact certain use cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:10
msgid ""
"The mesh analysis works in Edit Mode and shows areas with a high value in"
" red, and areas with a low value in blue. Geometry outside the range is "
"displayed gray."

msgid "Overhang."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:26
msgid ""
"Extrusion 3D printers have a physical limit to the overhang that can be "
"printed, this display mode shows the overhang with angle range and axis "
"selection."

msgid "Thickness."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:39
msgid ""
"Printers have a limited *wall-thickness* where very thin areas cannot be "
"printed, this test uses ray casting and a distance range to the thickness"
" of the geometry."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:52
msgid ""
"Another common cause of problems for printing are intersections between "
"surfaces, where the inside/outside of a model cannot be reliably "
"detected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:55

"Unlike other display modes, intersections have no variance and are either"

msgid ""
"Distorted geometry can cause problems since the triangulation of a "
"distorted ngon is undefined."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_analysis.rst:69
msgid ""
"Distortion is measured by faces which are not flat, with parts of the "
"face pointing in different directions."
