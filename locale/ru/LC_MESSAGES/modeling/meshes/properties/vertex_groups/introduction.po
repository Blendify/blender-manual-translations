"Vertex Groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a"
" Mesh Object or :term:`Lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the "
"hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character."
" In addition you can assign different *weight values* (in the range [ "
"0.0, 1.0 ] ) to the vertices within a Vertex Group. Hence Vertex Groups "
"are sometimes also named *Weight Groups*."
