"There are two different collision types that you may use: collision between "
"different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing straight "
"from the start: the primary targets of the collision calculation are the "
"vertices of a Soft Body. So if you have too few vertices too few collision "
"takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges and faces to improve the "
"collision calculation."

"A cube colliding with a plane works pretty well (*Image 2a*), but a plane "
"falls right through a cube that it is supposed to collide with (*Image 2b*)."
" Why is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see "
"if the four vertices of the plane collides with the cube as the plane is "
"pulled down by gravity. You can activate *CFace* to enable collision between"
" the face of the plane and the object instead (*Image 2c*), but this type of"

"In (*Image 3a*), you can see a vertex colliding with a plane. If a vertex "

"in the direction of the face normal. The position that a vertex finally ends"
" up in is dependent on the forces that act upon it. In the example gravity "
"and the repulsion force of the face balance out. The speed at which the "
"vertex is pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the *Choke* "

"Now lets see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them travel at"

"different speeds. The two on the far right (5 and 6) are traveling so fast "
"that they pass right through the collision zone (this is because of the "
"default solver precision - which we can fix later). You will notice that the"
" fourth vertex also travels quite fast and because it is heavier it breaches"
" the inner zone. The first three vertices collide OK."
