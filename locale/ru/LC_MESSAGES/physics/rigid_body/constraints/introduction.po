"The physics constraints available in the non-game modes are meant to be "
"attached to an :term:`Empty` object. The constraint then has fields which "
"can be pointed at the two physics-enabled object which will be bound by the "
"constraint. The *Empty* object provides a location and axis for the "
"constraint distinct from the two constrained objects. The location of the "
"entity hosting the physics constraint marks a location and set of axes on "
"each of the two constrained objects. These two anchor points are calculated "
"at the beginning of the animation and their position and orientation remain "
"fixed *in the local coordinate system of the object* for the duration of the"
" animation. The objects can move far from the constraint object, but the "
"constraint anchor moves with the object. If this feature seems limiting, "
"consider using multiple objects with a non-physics *Child-of* constraint and"
" animate the relative location of the child."
