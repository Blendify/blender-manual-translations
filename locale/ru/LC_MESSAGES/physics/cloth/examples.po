"To start with cloth, the first thing you need, of course, is some fabric."
" So, let us delete the default cube and add a plane. In order to get some"
" good floppy and flexible fabric, you will need to subdivide it several "
"times, about eight is a good number. So :kbd:`Tab` into *Edit Mode*, and "
"press :kbd:`W` :menuselection:`--> Subdivide multi`, and set it to 8."

"Now, we'll make this cloth by going to the Physics tab. Scroll down until"
" you see the *Cloth* panel, and press the *Cloth* button. Now, a lot of "
"settings will appear, most of which we'll ignore for now."

"That is all you need to do to set your cloth up for animating, but if you"
" press :kbd:`Alt-A`, your lovely fabric will just drop very un-"
"spectacularly. That is what we'll cover in the next two sections about "
"pinning and colliding."

"Another example of aging is a flag. Define the flag as a simple grid "
"shape and pin the edge against the flagpole. Simulate for 50 frames or "
"so, and the flag will drop to its \"rest\" position. Apply the *Cloth* "
"modifier. If you want the flag to flap or otherwise move in the scene, "
"re-enable it for the frame range when it is in camera view."

"smooth like the picture you need to apply a *Smooth* and/or *Subsurf* "
"modifier in the *Modifiers* tab. Then, in the same editor, find the "
"*Links and Materials* panel (the same one you used for vertex groups) and"
" press *Set Smooth*."
