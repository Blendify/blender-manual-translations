"To add an effect strip, select one base strip (image, movie, or scene) by"

"effect, you will need to :kbd:`Shift-LMB` a second overlapping strip (it "
"depends on the effect you want). From Add menu pick the effect you want. "
"When you do, the Effect strip will be shown above the source strips. If "
