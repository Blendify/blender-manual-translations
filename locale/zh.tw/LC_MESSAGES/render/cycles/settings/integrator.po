"The integrator is the rendering algorithm used to compute the lighting. "
"Cycles currently supports a path tracing integrator with direct light "
"sampling. It works well for various lighting setups, but is not as "
"suitable for caustics and some other complex lighting situations."

"Rays are traced from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until "

"indirect light sampling (letting the ray follow the surface BSDF) and "
"direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards "
