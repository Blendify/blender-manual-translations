"its target."

"Here we talk of *scale*, not of *size*! Indeed, you can have two objects,"
" one much bigger than the other, and yet both of them have the same "
"scale. This is also true with bones: in *Pose Mode*, they all have a "
"unitary scale when they are in rest position, represented by their "
"visible length."

"Since scale is a multiplicative quantity, it should be combined using "
"multiplication, and split into fractions or inverted via power. Thus the "
"use of *Power* is more mathematically correct than *Influence*, which "
"uses linear interpolation. The use of the *Additive* option is also not "
"recommended."
