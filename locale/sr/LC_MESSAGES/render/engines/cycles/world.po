"Currently this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as the"
" world surface shader or sun lamps will have no effect if a volume shader"
" is used. This is because the world background is assumed to be "
"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it "
"is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most "
"of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "

"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "

"Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is "
