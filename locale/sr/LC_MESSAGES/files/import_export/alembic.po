"Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic "
"distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-"
"independent set of baked geometric results. This 'distillation' of scenes"
" into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation of lighting"
" and rendering scenes into rendered image data."

"Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of complex"
" procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically **not** "
"concerned with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools "
"used to create the computed results. For example, Alembic will "
"efficiently store the animated vertex positions and animated transforms "
"that result from an arbitrarily complex animation and simulation process "
"which could involve enveloping, corrective shapes, volume-preserving "
"simulations, cloth and flesh simulations, and so on. Alembic will not "
"attempt to store a representation of the network of computations (rigs, "
"basically) which are required to produce the final, animated vertex "
"positions and animated transforms."

":abbr:`TL;DR (Too long; didn't read.)`: Alembic can be used to write an "
"animated mesh to disk, and read it back quickly and efficiently. This "
"means that a mesh can be animated with a very CPU-intensive rig, 'baked' "
"to an Alembic file, and loaded into the shot file for shading and "
"lighting with only moderate CPU usage."

"Due to the Open Source nature of the Alembic standard as well as the C++ "

"pipeline**. For example, other software, such as Houdini or Maya, can "

"in Blender. It is also possible to animate characters (or other models) "
"in Blender, export to Alembic, and load those files into other software "
