"The first step is to unwrap your mesh. You want to unwrap when you feel "
"your mesh is complete with respect to the number of faces it needs to "
"have. If you do add faces or subdivide existing faces when a model is "
"already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces for you, but you may "
"need to do additional mapping or editing. In this fashion, you can use "
"the UV texture image to guide additional geometry changes."

"Every point in the UV map corresponds to a vertex in the mesh. The lines "

"Each face of a mesh can have many UV textures. Each UV texture can have "
"an individual image assigned to it. When you unwrap a face to a UV "
"texture in the UV Editor, each face of the mesh is automatically assigned"
" *four UV coordinates:* These coordinates define the way an image or a "
"texture is mapped onto the face. These are 2D coordinates, which is why "
"they are called UV, to distinguish them from XYZ coordinates. These "
"coordinates can be used for rendering or for real-time viewport display "
"as well."

"Every face in Blender can have a link to a different image. The UV "
"coordinates define how this image is mapped onto the face. This image "
"then can be rendered or displayed in real-time. A 3D View has to be in "
"\"Face Select\" mode to be able to assign Images or change UV coordinates"
" of the active Mesh Object. This allows a face to participate in many UV "
"textures. A face at the hairline of a character might participate in the "
"facial UV texture, *and* in the scalp/hair UV texture."
