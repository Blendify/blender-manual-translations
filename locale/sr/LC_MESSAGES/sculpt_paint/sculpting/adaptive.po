msgid ""
"In order for sculpting to give accurate and predictable results, Blender "
"needs geometry to work with. One way to accomplish this is starting off "
"with a highly subdivided mesh. The other way involves using either of two"
" adaptive sculpting methods to add geometry dynamically."

msgid "Dynamic Topology"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:14
msgid ""
"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting method"
" that adds and removes details under the brush. This works by first "
"tessellating the mesh then applying the sculpting stroke on top of the "
"tessellated mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:18
msgid ""
"This makes it possible to sculpt complex shapes out of a simple mesh, "
"rather than just adding details onto a modeled base mesh."

msgid "Multiresolution Modifier"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:29
msgid ""
"The Multiresolution Modifier can be used to dynamically subdivide the "
"mesh. The more subdivision the more computing will be needed. With the "
"Blender stack non-destructive data, multi-resolution sculpting will help "
"when you have a clean topology base mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:33
msgid ""
"When sculpting with multiple resolutions you have the ability to sculpt "
"in different levels of subdivision, this mean you can sculpt some details"
" in subdivision level 1 and add more details in subdivision 2 and go back"
" to subdivision 1 correct some mistakes. While this workflow is often "
"used, the Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up "
"with some mesh distortions. As an advice, add as most details as possible"
" before adding more subdivisions. Clay brush works better with multi-"
"resolution sculpting to sculpt secondary forms."
