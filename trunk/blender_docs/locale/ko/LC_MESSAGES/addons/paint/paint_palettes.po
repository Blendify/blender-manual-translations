"This add-on can read and write Gimp's palette format. The first thing to "
"do is to determine your \"Palettes Folder\". This can be the Gimp's "
"palette folder, or it can be a specific one for your project. Select the "
"palette with the select menu. You can save your palette with the ``+`` "
"button. Add as many colors as you need with the ``+`` button at the left "
"of the index number field. Sample the current brush color with the small "
"color wheel button. Select a palette color with the small button under "
"the colors."
