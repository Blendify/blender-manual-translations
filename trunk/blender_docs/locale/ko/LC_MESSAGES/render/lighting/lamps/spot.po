"A *Spot* lamp emits a cone-shaped beam of light from the tip of the cone,"
" in a given direction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:9
msgid ""
"The *Spot* light is the most complex of the light objects and indeed, for"
" a long time, among the most used thanks to the fact that it was the only"
" one able to cast shadows. Nowadays, with a ray tracer integrated into "
"Blender's internal render engine, all lamps can cast shadows (except "
"*Hemi*). Even so, *Spot* lamps' shadow buffers are much faster to render "
"than ray-traced shadows, especially when blurred/softened, and spot lamps"
" also provide other functionality such as \"volumetric\" halos."

msgid "Size"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:42
msgid ""
"The size of the outer cone of a *Spot*, which largely controls the "
"circular area a *Spot* light covers. This slider in fact controls the "
"angle at the top of the lighting cone, and can be between (1.0 to 180.0)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:57
msgid ""
"The *Blend* slider controls the inner cone of the *Spot*. The *Blend* "
"value can be between (0.0 to 1.0). The value is proportional and "
"represents that amount of space that the inner cone should occupy inside "
"the outer cone *Size*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:62
msgid ""
"The inner cone boundary line indicates the point at which light from the "
"*Spot* will start to blur/soften; before this point its light will mostly"
" be full strength. The larger the value of *Blend* the more blurred/soft "
"the edges of the spotlight will be, and the smaller the inner cone's "
"circular area will be (as it starts to blur/soften earlier)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:67
msgid ""
"To make the *Spot* have a sharper falloff rate and therefore less "
"blurred/soft edges, decrease the value of *Blend*. Setting *Blend* to 0.0"
" results in very sharp spotlight edges, without any transition between "
"light and shadow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:71
msgid ""
"The falloff rate of the *Spot* lamp light is a ratio between the *Blend* "
"and *Size* values; the larger the circular gap between the two, the more "
"gradual the light fades between *Blend* and *Size*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:74
msgid ""
"*Blend* and *Size* only control the *Spot* light cone's aperture and "
"softness (\"radial\" falloff); they do not control the shadow's softness "
"as shown below."

"Render showing the soft edge spotlighted area and the sharp/hard object "
"shadow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:82
msgid ""
"Notice in the picture above that the object's shadow is sharp as a result"
" of the ray tracing, whereas the spotlight edges are soft. If you want "
"other items to cast soft shadows within the *Spot* area, you will need to"
" alter other shadow settings."
