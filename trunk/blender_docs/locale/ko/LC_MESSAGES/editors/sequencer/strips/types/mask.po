"A Mask Strip is used to select a mask data-block generated from "
":doc:`Movie Clip Editor </editors/movie_clip_editor/masking>`. This works"
" similar to the :doc:`Mask Node </compositing/types/input/mask>` but "
"without the options available for finer control. The mask image is always"
" generated at the render resolution, scaling along with different proxy "
"levels."
