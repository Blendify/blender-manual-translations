"Mesh objects, in particular meshes that have been modeled to represent "
"organic objects, often have geometry that is not particularly uniform. "
"This can cause problems if the object needs to be :ref:`rigged "
"<animation-rigging>` or just needs simpler geometry for workflows such as"
" 3D printing. Remeshing is a technique that rebuilds the geometry with a "
"more uniform topology. Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of "
"topology depending on the defined resolution. Remeshing is especially "
"useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`, to generate "
"better topology after blocking out the initial shape."
