"The *X-mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you edit both "
"\"sides\" of your mesh in a single action. When you transform an element "
"(vertex, edge or face), if there is its exact X-mirrored counterpart (in "
"local space), it will be transformed accordingly, through a symmetry "
"along the local X axis."

"The conditions for *X-Mirror* to work are quite strict, which can make it"
" difficult to use. To have an exact mirrored version of a (half) mesh, "
"its easier and simpler to use the :doc:`Mirror modifier "
"</modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>`"

"When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry the "
"vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not "
"exactly positioned in their mirror locations then *X Mirror* will not "
"treat those vertices as mirrored. This can be annoying because often the "
"out of position vertices are only very slightly out of position."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:47
msgid ""
"*Topology Mirror* tries to solve this problem by determining which "
"vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also"
" by looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh "
"Geometry. It looks at the overall Mesh Geometry topology to determine if "
"particular vertices will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is "
"that mirrored vertices can be non-symetrical and yet still be treated as "
"mirrored when *X Mirror* and *Topology Mirror* are both active."

"The *Topology Mirror* functionality will work more reliably on mesh "
"geometry which is more detailed. If you use very simple geometry for "
"example, a *Cube* or *UV Sphere* the *Topology Mirror* option will often "
"not work."
