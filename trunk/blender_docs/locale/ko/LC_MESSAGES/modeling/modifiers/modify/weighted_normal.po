msgid ""
"This modifier changes the custom normals of a mesh, using various "
"selectable methods. This can be useful to make some faces appear very "
"flat during shading, among other effects. See :doc:`Normals "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/normals>` for a description of normals and "
"custom normals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:14
msgid ""
"This modifier requires custom normals to be enabled, which can be done by"
" enabling Auto Smooth in the Mesh Properties panel. See :doc:`Normals "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/normals>`."

msgid "Weighting Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:23
msgid ""
"The normals around a vertex will be combined to create a custom (per-"
"face-at-a-vertex) normal using various weights for each. The *Weighting "
"Mode* defines how to compute the weights."

msgid "Face Area"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:27
msgid ""
"Weight according to the area of the face that the normal originates. A "
"larger area means that the normal will get a higher weight."

msgid "Corner Angle"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:31
msgid ""
"Weight according to the angle each face forms at the vertex. This is the "
"method Blender uses by default when combining normals at a vertex."

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:38
msgid ""
"Determines how strongly the weights are biased according to the face "
"areas and/or corner angles. A value of 50 means all faces are weighted "
"equally. More than 50 means faces with higher area or angles are given "
"even more weight. Less than 50 means faces with higher area or angles are"
" given lesser weights."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:45
msgid "Threshold"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:44
msgid ""
"A weight-rounding threshold which means that: if two angles or areas "
"differ by less than the threshold then they will get equal weights."

msgid "Vertex Group"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:48
msgid ""
"If a vertex group is specified, the modifier will only affect those "
"vertices. The button beside the data ID will invert the selection (only "
"affect the vertices *not* in the vertex group)."

msgid "Keep Sharp"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:53
msgid ""
"With this option enabled the modifier tries to preserve sharp edges, "
"though smoothing will still happen if there are multiple faces between "
"any two sharp edges."

msgid "Face Influence"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/modify/weighted_normal.rst:57
msgid ""
"Use face weights (weak, medium, or strong) as assigned by Custom Normal "
"Tools or by the *Set Strength Mode* of a Bevel modifier. For example, if "
"three faces meet at a vertex and have the face weights weak, medium, and "
"strong, then only the normal associated with the strong face will be used"
" to set the final result. See the Set Strength tool in :doc:`Normals "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/normals>` for how to set the face strengths."
