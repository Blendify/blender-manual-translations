"The *Force* field is the simplest of the fields. It gives a constant "
"force towards (positive strength) or away from (negative strength) the "
"object's center. Newtonian particles are attracted to a field with "
"negative strength, and are blown away from a field with positive "
"strength."

"For :doc:`Boids Particles </physics/particles/emitter/physics/index>` a "
