msgid ""
"The *Stretch To* constraint causes its owner to rotate and scale its Y "
"axis towards its target. So it has the same tracking behavior as the "
":doc:`Track To constraint </animation/constraints/tracking/track_to>`. "
"However, it assumes that the Y axis will be the tracking and stretching "
"axis, and does not give you the option of using a different one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/tracking/stretch_to.rst:12
msgid ""
"It also optionally has some raw volumetric features, so the owner can "
"squash down as the target moves closer, or thin out as the target moves "
"farther away. Note however, that it is not the real volume of the owner "
"which is thus preserved, but rather the virtual one defined by its scale "
"values. Hence, this feature works even with non-volumetric objects, like "
"empties, 2D meshes or surfaces, and curves."

"With bones, the \"volumetric\" variation scales them along their own "
"local axes (remember that the local Y axis of a bone is aligned with it, "
