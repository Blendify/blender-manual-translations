"A *Keyframe* is simply a marker of time which stores the value of a "
"property."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:8

"For example, a Keyframe might define that the horizontal position of a "
"cube is at 3m on frame 1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:10
msgid ""
"The purpose of a Keyframe is to allow for interpolated animation, "
"meaning, for example, that the user could then add another key on frame "
"10, specifying the cube's horizontal position at 20m, and Blender will "
"automatically determine the correct position of the cube for all the "
"frames between frame 1 and 10 depending on the chosen interpolation "
"method (e.g. Linear, Bézier, Quadratic, etc.)."

"Keyframe interpolation is represented and controlled by :doc:`animation "

"the :doc:`Graph Editor </editors/graph_editor/index>`."

"The X axis of the curve corresponds to time, while Y represents the value"
" of the property. Keyframes themselves define points of the curve, while "
"interpolation is controlled by additional parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/keyframes/introduction.rst:48
msgid ""
"The :ref:`Interpolation Mode <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-"
"interpolation>` is the main setting that specifies for each keyframe how "
"the curve is interpolated from that key to the next one. There are a "
"number of modes with fixed shapes, e.g. *Constant*, *Linear*, *Quadratic*"
" etc, and a free form *Bézier* mode."

msgid ""
":ref:`Extrapolation <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-extrapolation>` "
"specifies how the curve extends before the first, and after the last "

"also possible to configure the curve to loop."

"*Bézier* interpolation is controlled by handles, which have a "
":ref:`handle type <editors-graph-fcurves-settings-handles>` and position."
" The position of *Free* and *Aligned* handles must be set manually from "
"the Graph editor, while *Vector*, *Automatic* and *Auto Clamped* handles "

msgid ""
"The method how the three automatic handle types are computed is "
"controlled by the per-curve :ref:`Auto Handle Smoothing <graph_editor-"
"auto-handle-smoothing>` setting. The *None* mode resembles how most other"
" software works and only considers the values of the immediately adjacent"
" keys. The *Continuous Acceleration* mode considers the shape of the "
"whole curve, which produces smoother results out of the box, but means "
"that changes in one key affect interpolation over a larger section of the"
" curve; it also tends to overshoot more with *Automatic* handles."
