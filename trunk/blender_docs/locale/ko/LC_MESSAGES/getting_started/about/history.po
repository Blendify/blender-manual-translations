"In 1988, Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. "
"NeoGeo quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands "
"and one of the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-"
"winning productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for "
"large corporate clients such as the multinational electronics company "
"Philips. Within NeoGeo, Ton was responsible for both art direction and "
"internal software development. After careful deliberation, Ton decided "
"that the current in-house 3D tool set for NeoGeo was too old and "
"cumbersome to maintain, and needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 "
"this rewrite began and was destined to become the 3D software creation we"
" all know as Blender. As NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender, "
"it became apparent to Ton that Blender could be used as a tool for other "
"artists outside of NeoGeo."

"1988년 Ton Roosendaal은 네덜란드 애니메이션 스튜디오 NeoGeo를 공동 설립했습니다. NeoGeo는 네덜란드 최대 "
"규모의 3D 애니메이션 스튜디오이자 유럽 최고의 애니메이션 하우스 중 하나가 되었습니다. 곧 NeoGeo는 다국적 전자 회사인 "
"필립스(Philips)와 같은 대기업 고객을 대상으로 결과물을 내놓고 있었고, 그 작품들은 큰 상을 수상(European "
"Corporate Video Awards 1993 및 1995)할 정도였습니다. NeoGeo에서 Ton은 아트 디렉션과 내부 "
"소프트웨어 개발을 담당했습니다. 신중한 심의를 거친 후, Ton은 NeoGeo에 대한 현재 사내의 3D 도구 세트가 너무 오래되어 "
"유지 관리가 번거롭고 처음부터 다시 작성해야한다고 결정했습니다. 1995 년에이 재작성이 시작되었고, 우리 모두가 블렌더로 알고있는"
" 3D 소프트웨어는 그렇게 탄생했습니다. NeoGeo가 계속해서 블렌더를 수정하고 향상시킴에 따라 블렌더가 NeoGeo 외부의 다른"
" 아티스트를 위한 도구로도 사용될 수 있을 것이라고 Ton은 생각했습니다."

"In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as "
"a spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core "
"of NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross-platform 3D"
" application for free. At the time, this was a revolutionary concept as "
"most commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to "
"bring professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach"
" of the general computing public. NaN's business model involved providing"
" commercial products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended "
"its first SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote "
"Blender. Blender's first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and "
"gathered a tremendous amount of interest from both the press and "
"attendees. Blender was a hit and its huge potential confirmed!"
msgstr ""
"1998년, Ton은 NeoGeo의 분사로 Blender를 추가로 시장에 내놓고 개발하기 위해 Not a Number (NaN)라는"
" 새로운 회사를 설립하기로 결정했습니다. NaN의 핵심은 자유롭고 컴팩트 한 플랫폼 간 3D 응용 프로그램을 만들고 배포하려는 "
"욕구였습니다. 당시 대부분의 상업용 3D 응용 프로그램은 수천 달러의 비용이 들기 때문에 혁신적인 개념이었습니다. NaN은 일반 "
"컴퓨터 사용자에게 전문적인 수준의 3D 모델링 및 애니메이션 도구를 제공하기를 희망했습니다. NaN의 비즈니스 모델은 "
"Blender를 대상으로 상용 제품과 서비스를 제공하는 것과 관련이 있습니다. 1999 년에 NaN은 Blender를 더 널리 "
"홍보하기 위해 SIGGRAPH 컨퍼런스에 처음 참석했습니다. Blender의 첫 SIGGRAPH 컨벤션은 거대한 성공을 거두었으며 "
"언론과 참석자 모두 엄청난 관심을 모았습니다. 블렌더는 히트를 쳤고, 그 거대한 잠재력이 드러나는 순간이었습니다."

msgid ""
"Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN "
"secured financing of €4.5M from venture capitalists. This large inflow of"
" cash enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN boasted as "
"many as 50 employees working around the world trying to improve and "
"promote Blender. In the summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This "
"version of Blender added the integration of a game engine to the 3D "
"application. By the end of 2000, the number of users registered on the "
"NaN website exceeded 250,000."

"Unfortunately, NaN's ambitions and opportunities did not match the "
"company's capabilities and the market realities of the time. This over-"
"extension resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a "
"smaller company in April 2001. Six months later NaN's first commercial "
"software product, Blender Publisher was launched. This product was "
"targeted at the emerging market of interactive web-based 3D media. Due to"
" disappointing sales and the ongoing difficult economic climate, the new "
"investors decided to shut down all NaN operations. The shutdown also "
"included discontinuing the development of Blender. Although there were "
"clearly shortcomings in the then current version of Blender, such as a "
"complex internal software architecture, unfinished features and a non-"
"standard way of providing the GUI, the enthusiastic support from the user"
" community and customers who had purchased Blender Publisher in the past,"
" meant that Ton could not justify leaving Blender to fade into "
"insignificance. Since restarting a company with a sufficiently large team"
" of developers was not feasible, Ton Roosendaal founded the non-profit "
"organization, Blender Foundation, in March 2002."
msgstr ""
"불행히도 NaN의 야망은 회사의 역량, 시장 상황과 맞지 않았습니다. 무리한 확장으로 인해 새로운 투자 자금을 모으고 2001년 "
"4월에 소규모 회사로 NaN이 다시 시작되었습니다. 6개월 후 NaN의 첫 상용 소프트웨어 제품인 Blender Publisher가"
" 출시되었습니다. 이 제품은 반응형(interactive) 웹 기반 3D 미디어의 신흥 시장을 겨냥한 제품입니다. 그러나 실망스러운"
" 매출과 어려운 경제 환경으로 인해 새로운 투자자는 모든 NaN 작업을 중단하기로 결정했습니다. 종료에는 Blender의 개발을 "
"중단하는 것도 포함되어 있었습니다. 복잡한 내부 소프트웨어 아키텍처, 미완성 기능 및 GUI를 제공하는 비표준 방식과 같은 블렌더의"
" 당시 버전에는 분명히 단점이 있었지만, 사용자 커뮤니티 및 Blender Publisher를 구입한 고객의 열렬한 응원은 Ton이"
" 블렌더를 그냥 떠날 수는 없다는 메시지였습니다. 그리고 Ton Roosendaal은 2002년 3월에 비영리 단체 Blender "
"Foundation을 설립했습니다."

"The Blender Foundation's primary goal was to find a way to continue "
"developing and promoting Blender as a community-based `open source "
"<https://opensource.org/>`__ project. In July 2002, Ton managed to get "
"the NaN investors to agree to a unique Blender Foundation plan to attempt"
" to release Blender as open source. The \"Free Blender\" campaign sought "
"to raise €100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the "
"Blender source code and intellectual property rights from the NaN "
"investors and subsequently release Blender to the open source community. "
"With an enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN "
"employees, a fundraising campaign was launched to \"Free Blender\". To "
"everyone's surprise and delight the campaign reached the €100,000 goal in"
" only seven short weeks. On Sunday, October 13, 2002, Blender was "
"released to the world under the terms of the `GNU GPL "
"<https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl>`__. Blender development continues to "
"this day, driven by a team of dedicated volunteers from around the world "
"led by Blender's original creator, Ton Roosendaal."
msgstr ""
"블렌더 재단의 기본 목표는 블렌더를 커뮤니티 기반의 `오픈 소스 <https://opensource.org/>`__ 프로젝트로 "
"개발하고 홍보하는 방법을 찾는 것이었습니다. 2002년 7월 Ton은 NaN 투자자들이 블렌더를 공개 소스로 출시하려는 독자적인 "
"블렌더 설립 계획에 동의하도록 만들었습니다. \"Free Blender\" 캠페인은 10만 유로를 모금하여 NaN 투자자로부터 "
"블렌더 소스 코드와 지적 재산권에 대한 권리를 매입한 다음 블렌더를 오픈소스 커뮤니티에 공개할 수 있게 했습니다. 열정적인 "
"기여자들과 함께, 여러 명의 전직 NaN 직원들과 함께, \"Free Blender\" 모금 캠페인이 시작되었습니다. 단 7주만에 "
"€100,000 목표에 도달한 캠페인은 모두를 놀라게 했습니다. 2002년 10월 13일 일요일 블렌더는 `GNU GPL "
"<https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl>`__ 의 조건에 따라 세상에 공개되었습니다. 블렌더 개발은 오늘날 "
"Blender의 창시자인 Ton Roosendaal이 이끄는 전 세계의 헌신적인 자발적 팀이 주도해 왔습니다."
