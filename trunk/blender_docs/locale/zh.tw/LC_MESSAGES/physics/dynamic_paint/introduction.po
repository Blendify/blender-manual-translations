"Dynamic paint is a modifier and physics system that can turn objects into"
" paint canvases and brushes, creating vertex colors, image sequences or "
"displacement. This makes many effects possible like, for example "
"footsteps in the snow, raindrops that make the ground wet, paint that "
"sticks to walls, or objects that gradually freeze."
