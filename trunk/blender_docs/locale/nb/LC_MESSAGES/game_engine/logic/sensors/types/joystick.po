"The *Joystick Sensor* triggers whenever the joystick moves. It also "
"detects events on a range of ancillary controls on the joystick device "
"(hat, buttons, etc.). More than one joystick may be used (see \"Index\")."
" The exact layout of the joystick controls will depend on the make and "
"model of joystick used."
