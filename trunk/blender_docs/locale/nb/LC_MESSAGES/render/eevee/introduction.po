"Eevee is Blender's realtime render engine built using :term:`OpenGL` "
"focused on speed and interactivity while achieving the goal of rendering "
":abbr:`PBR (Physically Based Rendering)` materials. Eevee can be used "
"interactively in the 3D Viewport but also produce high quality final "

"Eevee materials are created using the same shader nodes as Cycles, making"
" it easy to render existing scenes. For Cycles users, this makes Eevee "
"work great to preview material in realtime."

"Unlike Cycles, Eevee is not a raytrace render engine. Instead of "
"computing each ray of light, Eevee uses a process called rasterization. "
"Rasterization estimates the way light interacts with objects and "
"materials using numerous algorithms. While Eevee is designed to use "
":abbr:`PBR (Physically Based Rendering)` principles, it is not perfect "
"and Cycles will always provide more physically accurate renders. Because "
"Eevee uses rasterization it has a large set of :doc:`limitations "
"</render/eevee/limitations>`."
