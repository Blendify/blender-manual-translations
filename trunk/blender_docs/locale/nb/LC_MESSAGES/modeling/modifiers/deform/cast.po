"This modifier shifts the shape of a mesh, curve, surface or lattice to "
"any of a few pre-defined shapes (sphere, cylinder, cuboid)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/cast.rst:10
msgid ""
"It is equivalent to the *To Sphere* tool in *Edit Mode* "
":menuselection:`Mesh --> Transform --> To Sphere`, :kbd:`Alt-Shift-S` and"
" what other programs call \"Spherify\" or \"Spherize\", but, as written "
"above, it is not limited to casting to a sphere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/cast.rst:18
msgid ""
"The :doc:`Smooth Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/smooth>` is a good "
"companion to *Cast*, since the cast shape sometimes needs smoothing to "
"look nicer or even to fix shading artifacts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/cast.rst:24
msgid ""
"For performance reasons, this modifier only works with local coordinates."
" If the modified object looks wrong, you may need to apply its rotation "
":kbd:`Ctrl-A`, especially when casting to a cylinder."

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/cast.rst:47
msgid ""
"The factor to control blending between original and cast vertex "
"positions. It is a linear interpolation: 0.0 gives original coordinates "
"(i.e. modifier has no effect), 1.0 casts to the target shape. Values "
"below 0.0 or above 1.0 exaggerate the deformation, sometimes in "
"interesting ways."
