"The purpose of this feature is to smooth out jerky camera handling on "
"existing real-world footage. To activate the 2D stabilizer, you need to "
"set the toggle in the panel, and additionally you need to enable *Show "
"Stable* in the Clip Display pop-over. Then you'll need to set up some "
"tracking points to detect the image movements."

"The 2D Stabilization panel is used to define the data used for 2D "
"stabilization of the shot. Several options are available in this panel: "
"you may add a list of tracks to determine lateral image shifts and "
"another list of tracks to determine tilting and zooming movements. Based "
"on the average contribution of these tracks, a compensating movement is "
"calculated and applied to each frame."
