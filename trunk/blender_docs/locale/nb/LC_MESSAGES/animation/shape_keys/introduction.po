"Shape keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In "
"other terminology, shape keys may be called \"morph targets\" or \"blend "
"shapes\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/shape_keys/introduction.rst:9
msgid ""
"The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial "
"animation and in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig. They are "
"particularly useful for modeling organic soft parts and muscles where "
"there is a need for more control over the resulting shape than what can "
"be achieved with combination of rotation and scale."

"Shape keys can be applied on object types with vertices like mesh, curve,"
" surface and lattice."

"Shape keys are authored in the :doc:`Shape Keys panel "
"</animation/shape_keys/shape_keys_panel>` which is accessed in the Object"
" Data tab of the Properties editor (e.g. the Mesh tab for mesh objects)."

"A shape key is modified by first selecting a shape key in the panel, and "
"then moving the object's vertices to a new position in the 3D Viewport."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/shape_keys/introduction.rst:31
msgid ""
"The panel has controls for affecting the current *Value* (influence, "
"weight) of a shape. It is possible to see a shape in isolation or how it "
"combines with others."

msgid "Adding and Removing Vertices"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/shape_keys/introduction.rst:38
msgid ""
"It is not possible to add or remove vertices in a shape key. The number "
"of vertices and how they connect is specified by the mesh, curve, surface"
" or lattice. A shape key merely records a position for each vertex and "
"therefore shapes always contain all the object's vertices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/shape_keys/introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in "
"which it is created. Workflow-wise, adding and deleting vertices after "
"creating shape keys is possible, but it is best to leave the creation of "
"shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable."

"When adding a new shape key from :menuselection:`Specials --> New Shape "
"from Mix`, the shape will start of with the vertex configuration that is "
"visible at that moment."

msgid ""
"When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to"
" first create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or "
"surprise), and then break this complex shape into components by applying "
"a temporary vertex group to the complex shape and creating a copy with "
"*New Shape from Mix*. This technique helps reducing conflicts between "
"different shape keys that would otherwise produce a double effect."
