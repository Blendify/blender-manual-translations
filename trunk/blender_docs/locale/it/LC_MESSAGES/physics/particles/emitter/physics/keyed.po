"The particle paths of keyed particles are determined from the emitter to "
"another particle system's particles. This allows creation of chains of "
"systems with keyed physics to create long strands or groovy moving "
"particles. Basically the particles have no dynamics but are interpolated "
"from one system to the next at drawtime."

"to the second, and in further 25 frames from the second system to the "
"target. If you use the Timed button for the first system, the Time slider"
" appears in the second systems panel. Its default value is 0.5, so the "
"time is equally split between the systems. If you set Time to 1, the "
"movement from the first system to the second will get all the lifetime "
