"The most basic element, a vertex, can be added with a left button mouse "
"click while pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` when no other vertices are selected, or "
":kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`. Because the camera space (computer screen) is two-"
"dimensional, Blender cannot determine all three vertex coordinates from a"
" single mouse click, so the new vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D "
"cursor."

"To create interconnected vertices, you can add a vertex and continuously "
"make subsequent :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` operations with the last one vertex "
"selected. This will link the last selected vertex with the vertex created"
" at the mouse position with an edge (See Fig. :ref:`fig-mesh-basics-add-"
"one`), and will continuously connect them creating vertices if you "
"continue repeating this operation. (see Fig. 3 Creating simple connected "
"vertices with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`)."

"If you have two vertices selected and already connected with an edge, "
"left-click while pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` will create a planar face, also"
" known as a quad. Blender will follow your mouse cursor and will use the "
"planar view from your viewport to create those quads."

msgid ""
"For :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, Blender will automatically rotate the last selected "
"Edge (the source) for the subsequent operations if you have at least one "
"face created, dividing the angles created between the newly-created edge "
"and the last two edges, performing a smooth angle between them. Blender "
"will calculate this angle using the last positive and negative position "
"of the last X and Y coordinates and the last connected unselected edge. "
"If this angle exceeds a negative limit (following a quadrant rule) "
"between the recently created edge and the last two, Blender will wrap the"
" faces. But if you do not want Blender rotating and smoothing edges "
"automatically when extruding from :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you can also inhibit "
"Blender from rotating sources using the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-LMB`. "
"In this case, Blender will not rotate the source dividing the angle "
"between those edges when creating a face."

"For both cases, Blender will inform the user about the source rotation "
"during the creation process. If you look at the Bottom of the Mesh Tools "
"Panel, if you press :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, you will see that the Rotate Source "
"is automatically checked and if :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-LMB` is used, it will be"
" automatically unchecked. Examples:"

"If you have three or more vertices selected, and left click with mouse "

"When adding Objects with :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, The extrusions of the selected "
"elements, being vertices, edges and faces with the :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB`, is "
"viewport dependent. This means, once you change your viewport, for "
"example, from top to left, bottom or right, the extrusion direction will "
