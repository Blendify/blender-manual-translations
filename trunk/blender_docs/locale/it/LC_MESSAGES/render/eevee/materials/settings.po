msgid ""
"When writing to the color buffer using transparent blend modes, the order"

" sorting or per-triangle sorting. Only per-object sorting is available "
"and is automatically done on all transparent surfaces based on object "
"origin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/materials/settings.rst:65
msgid ""
"This per-object sorting has already a cost and having thousands of these "
"objects in a scene will greatly degrade performance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/materials/settings.rst:68
msgid ""
"Additive and Multiplicative blending are, individually, order "
"independent. This means all the triangles of a surface rendered with one "
"of these blending mode will always output the expected result if they do "
"not intersect with other transparent surfaces. This will work even if the"
" triangles of that surface intersect each others."
