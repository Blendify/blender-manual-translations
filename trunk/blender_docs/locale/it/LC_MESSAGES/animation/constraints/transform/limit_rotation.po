"An object or bone can be rotated around the X, Y and Z axes. This "
"constraint restricts the amount of allowed rotations around each axis, "
"through lower and upper bounds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_rotation.rst:11
msgid ""
"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered rotations of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have rotation values outside "
"the minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in the *Transform* "
"panel. When an owner is rotated and attempted to be rotated outside the "
"limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and"
" when rendered, but internally, its rotation values will still be changed"
" beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem "
"to jump to its internally specified rotation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_rotation.rst:20
msgid ""
"Similarly, if its owner has an internal rotation that is beyond the "
"limit, rotating it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing "
"until the internal rotation values are back within the limit threshold "
"(unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_rotation.rst:24
msgid ""
"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's "
"rotation around that axis... Although this is possible, using the "
"*Transformation Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier."

"These buttons enable the rotation limit around respectively the X, Y and "

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can "
"still have rotations out of bounds (as shown by the *Transform* panel). "
"Well, when you enable this button, this is no more possible -- the owner "
"transform properties are also limited by the constraint. Note however, "
"that the constraint does not directly modifies the rotation values: you "
"have to rotate one way or the other its owner, for this to take effect..."
