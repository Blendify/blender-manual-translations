"Grease Pencil sketches are organized in layers, much like the image "
"layers in the GIMP or Photoshop. These layers are not related to any of "
"the other layer systems in Blender."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/interface/grease_pencil/layers_and_animation.rst:12
msgid ""
"The layers' main purpose is to gather sketches that are related in some "
"meaningful way (i.e. \"blocking notes\", \"director's comments on "
"blocking\", or \"guidelines\"). For this reason, all the strokes on a "
"layer (not just those made after a particular change) are affected by "
"that layer's color, opacity, and stroke thickness settings."

"Use the adjacent controls to Add, Remove or adjust the position of a "

"There is a list of layers attached to each scene and a list of layers "

"Use the Grease Pencil to do basic pencil tests (i.e. 2D animation in "
"flipbook style). Sketches are stored on the frame that they were drawn "
"on, as a separate drawing (only on the layer that they exist on). Each "
"drawing is visible until the next drawing for that layer is encountered. "
"The only exception to this is the first drawing for a layer, which will "
"also be visible before the frame it was drawn on."

"Onion-skinning, also known as ghosting, helps an animator by displaying "

"It is possible to set a Grease-Pencil block to be loaded up in the "
"*DopeSheet* for editing of the timings of the drawings. This is "
"especially useful for animators blocking out shots, where the ability to "
"re-time blocking is one of the main purposes of the whole exercise."

"At this point, the *DopeSheet* should now display a few \"channels\" with"

"It is possible to copy sketches from a layer/layers to other layers in "

"*Action Editor*."

"Sketches can also be copied from one screen (or view) to another using "
