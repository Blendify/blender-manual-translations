"The *Luminance Key* node determines background objects from foreground "

" this is useful when compositing stock footage of explosions (very bright) "
"which are normally shot against a solid, dark background."

"For this example, let's throw you a ringer. Here, the model was shot against"
" a *white* background. Using the Luminance Key node, we get a matte out "
"where the background is white, and the model is black; the opposite of what "
"we want. If we wanted to use the matte, we have to switch the white and the "
"black. How to do this? ColorRamp to the rescue - we set the left color White"
" Alpha 1.0, and the right color to be Black Alpha 0.0. Thus, when the "
"Colorramp gets in black, it spits out white, and vice versa. The reversed "
"mask is shown; her white outline is useable as an alpha mask now."

"Now to mix, we don't really need the AlphaOver node; we can just use the "
"mask as our Factor input. In this kinda weird case, we can use the matte "
"directly; we just switch the input nodes. As you can see, since the matte is"
" white (1.0) where we don't want to use the model picture, we feed the "
"background photo to the bottom socket (recall the mix node uses the top "
"socket where the factor is 0.0, and the bottom socket where the factor is "
"1.0). Feeding our original photo into the top socket means it will be used "
"where the Luminance Key node has spit out Black. Voila, our model is "
"teleported from Atlanta to aboard a cruise ship docked in Miami."
