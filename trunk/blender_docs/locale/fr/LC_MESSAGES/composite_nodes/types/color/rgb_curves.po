"For each color component channel (RGB) or the composite (C), this node "

"In this example, the White Level is set to the color of a bright spot of the"
" sand in the background, and the Black Level to the color in the center of "
"the fish's eye. To do this efficiently it's best to bring up an image viewer"
" window showing the original input image. You can then use the levels' color"
" picker to easily choose the appropriate colors from the input image, "
"zooming in to pixel level if necessary. The result can be fine-tuned with "
"the R,G, and B curves like in the previous example."

"Note that e.g. setting Black Level to red and White Level to blue does not "
"simply substitute black with red and white with blue as the example image "
"might suggest. Levels do color scaling, not substitution, but depending on "
"the settings they can result in the described color substitution."

"(What really happens when setting Black Level to pure red and White Level to"
