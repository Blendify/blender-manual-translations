"The Composite node is where the actual output from the compositor is "
"connected to the renderer. Connecting a node to the *Composite* node will "
"output the result of that node's full tree to the Renderer; leaving this "
"node unconnected will result in a blank image. This node is updated after "
"each render, but also if you change things in your node-tree (provided at "
"least one finished input node is connected)."

"You can connect three channels: the actual RGBA image, the Alpha image, and "
"the Z (depth) image. You should only have one Composite node in your map so "
"that only one final image is rendered when the *Compositing* button is "
"pressed on the Render Options Post-Processing panel. Otherwise, "
"unpredictable results may occur."

"The RENDER button renders a single frame or image. Save your image using "

"To save a sequence of images, for example, if you input a movie clip or used"
" a Time node with each frame in its own file, use the *ANIM* button and its "
"settings. If you might want to later overlay them, be sure to use an image "
"format that supports an Alpha channel (such as PNG). If you might want to "
"later arrange them front to back or create a depth of field effect, use a "
"format that supports a Z-depth channel (such as EXR)."
