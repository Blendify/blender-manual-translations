"The *Locked Track* constraint is a bit tricky to explain, both graphically "
"and textually. Basically, it is a :doc:`Track To constraint "
"</rigging/constraints/tracking/track_to>`, but with a locked axis, i.e. an "
"axis that cannot rotate (change its orientation). Hence, the owner can only "
"track its target by rotating around this axis, and unless the target is in "
"the plane perpendicular to the locked axis, and crossing the owner, this "
"owner cannot really point at its target."

"Let's take the best real world equivalent: a compass. It can rotate to point"
" in the general direction of its target (the magnetic North, or a neighbor "
"magnet), but it can't point *directly at it*, because it spins like a wheel "
"on an axle. If a compass is sitting on a table and there is a magnet "
"directly above it, the compass can't point to it. If we move the magnet more"
" to one side of the compass, it still can't point *at* the target, but it "
"can point in the general direction of the target, and still obey its "
"restrictions of the axle."

"When using a *Locked Track* constraint, you can think of the target as a "
"magnet, and the owner as a compass. The *Lock* axis will function as the "
"axle around which the owner spins, and the *To* axis will function as the "
"compass' needle. Which axis does what is up to you!"

"If you have trouble understanding the buttons of this constraint, read the "
"tool-tips, they are pretty good. If you don't know where your object's axes "
"are, turn on the *Axis* button in the *Object* menu's *Draw* panel. Or, if "
"you're working with bones, turn on the *Axes* button in the *Armature* "
"menu's *Display* panel."

"This constraint was designed to work cooperatively with the *Track To* "
"constraint. If you set the axes buttons right for these two constraints, "
"*Track To* can be used to point the axle at a primary target, and *Locked "
"Track* can spin the owner around that axle to a secondary target."
