msgid ""
"The *Wipe* transition strip can be used to transition from one strip to "
"the next. The wipe will have no effect if created from a single strip "
"instead of two strips. The duration of the wipe is the intersection of "
"the two source strips and cannot be adjusted. To adjust the start and end"
" of the wipe you must adjust the temporal bounds of the source strips in "
"a way that alters their intersection."
