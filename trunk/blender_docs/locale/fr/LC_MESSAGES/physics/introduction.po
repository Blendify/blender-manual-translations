"Gravity is a global setting that is applied the same to all physics systems "
"in a scene, which can be found in the scene tab. This value is generally "
"fine left at its default value, at ``-9.810`` in the Z axis, which is the "
"force of gravity in the real world. Lowering this value would simulate a "
"lower or higher force of gravity. Gravity denoted g, measurement [m×s "
":sup:`-2`])."

"Gravity is practically same around whole **Earth**. For rendering scenes "
