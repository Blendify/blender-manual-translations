"Fluid simulations are widely used in CG, and a very desired feature of any "
"particle system, fluid particles are similar to newtonian ones but this time"
" particles are influenced by internal forces like pressure, surface tension,"
" viscosity, springs, etc. Blender particle fluids use the SPH techniques to "
"solve the particles fluid equations."

"Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for "
"simulating fluid flows. It has been used in many fields of research, "
"including astrophysics, ballistics, vulcanology, and oceanography. It is a "
"mesh-free Lagrangian method (where the co-ordinates move with the fluid), "
"and the resolution of the method can easily be adjusted with respect to "
"variables such as the density."
