"Cycles is Blender’s ray-trace based production render engine. Since its "
"release as Apache 2.0 (permissive open source), it’s also in use by other"
" 3D tools, such as Poser and Rhino. Cycles can be used as part of Blender"
" and as stand-alone, making it a perfect solution for massive rendering "
"on clusters or at cloud providers."

"To use Cycles, it must be set as the active render engine in the top "
"header. Once that is done, interactive rendering can be started by "
"setting a 3D view editor to draw mode Rendered using :kbd:`Shift-Z`. The "
"render will keep updating as modifications are done, such as changing a "
"material color, changing a lamp's intensity or moving objects around. To "
"perform a full render go to :menuselection:`Properties --> Render` here "
"you can either choose to render a still image or an :doc:`Animation "
"</render/workflows/animations>`."
