"Blending Modes are different methods of controlling how the texture "
"influences material properties. While a blending mode defines the specific "
"operation performed, blending factor controls the amount, the overall "
"\"strength\" of this operation. For textures such blending factor is set via"
" sliders in the Influence panel. Throughout this section, the term *base "
"layer* refers to the base material color being manipulated (as defined by "
"texture's Influence) and *Blend Layer* refers to the texture. Following is a"
