"Masks have many purposes. They can be used in a motion tracking workflow to "
"mask out, or influence a particular object in the footage. They can be used "
"for manual rotoscoping to pull a particular object out of the footage, or as"
" a rough matte for green screen keying. Masks are independent from a "
"particular image of movie clip, and so they can just as well be used for "
"creating motion graphics or other effects in the compositor. These masks can"
" also be used in other places in Blender."

"Masks can be created in the image and movie clip editors, by changing the "
"mode from View to Mask in the header. This will add various tools and "
"properties to the editor panels, while hiding others that are not needed for"
" interacting with masks. The tools and panels available to edit masks are "
"the same in both editors, with the exception that linking masks to motion "
"tracking data is only possible in the movie clip editor."

"Once set to Mask mode, a Mask datablock can be added. Any image, movie clip,"
" render or compositing result can be used as a backdrop to draw masks over. "
"To get interactive feedback on the resulting mask, a Mask node can be "
"connected directly to a Viewer node in the compositor, which will then keep "
"updating the compositing result while editing."

"The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bezier curve, but "

"stuck to the curve as you edited it, for ease of editing an animation. These"

"Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the "
"feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each "
"feather point is stored in UV space, where U means position across spline "
"segment, and V means distance between main spline and feather points."

"This allows for deforming the main spline in almost any way, and the feather"
" will be updated automatically to reflect that change. For example if "
"there's just rotation of the spline, feather would stay completely "
"unchanged. If one point's feather is moved, the other feathers will be "
"automatically stretched uniformly along that segment and the overall shape "
"will be almost the same as artists would want it to be."

"Editing of mask splines happens in a way similar to editing bezier curves or"
" paths in GIMP or other curve editors: control points are added to define "
"the spline itself, and handles of different types are used to create smooth "

"follow an object in footage."
