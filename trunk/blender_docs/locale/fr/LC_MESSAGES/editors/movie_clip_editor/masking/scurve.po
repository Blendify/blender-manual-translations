msgid ""
"The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, but "
"with some differences. Smooth edges of the mask are defined by feathering. "
"The curve needed to support feathering in a way that stuck to the curve as "
"you edited it, for ease of editing an animation. These are called S-Curves."

"Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the "
"feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each "
"feather point is stored in UV space, where U means position across spline "
"segment, and V means distance between main spline and feather points."

"This allows for deforming the main spline in almost any way, and the feather "
"will be updated automatically to reflect that change."

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/masking/scurve.rst:23
msgid ""
"For example if there is just rotation of the spline, feather would stay "
"completely unchanged. If one point's feather is moved, the other feathers "
"will be automatically stretched uniformly along that segment and the overall "
"shape will be almost the same as artists would want it to be."
