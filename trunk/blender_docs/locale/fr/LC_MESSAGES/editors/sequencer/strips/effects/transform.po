"Transform is a swiss-army knife of image manipulation. It scales, shifts, "
"and rotates the images within a strip. The example to the right shows what "
"can be done with a single image. To make a smooth transition to the final "
"effect, enable the *Frame locked* button and define a curve in the Ipo "
"Window (Sequence mode)."
