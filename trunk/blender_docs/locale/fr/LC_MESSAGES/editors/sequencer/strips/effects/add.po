"The Add Effect adds the colors of two strips together, Use this effect with "
"a base image strip, and a modifier strip. The modifier strip is either a "
"solid color or a black-and-whte mask, or another image entirely. The example"
" to the right shows what happens when you add gray to an image, and animate "
"the effect over time. The image gets bright because we are adding gray "
"(R:.5, G:.5, B:.5) to say, a blue color (R.1, G:.1, B:.5) resulting in "
"(R:.6, G:.6, B:1.0) which retains the original hue (relationship between the"
" colors) but is much brighter (has a higher value). When applied to the "
"whole image like this, the whole image seems to flash."

"You can use this effect to increase the brightness of an image, or if you "
"use a BW mask, selectively increase the brightness of certain areas of the "
"image. The Mix node, in Add mode, does exactly the same thing as the Add sfx"
" strip here, and is controlled the same way by feeding the Factor input."
