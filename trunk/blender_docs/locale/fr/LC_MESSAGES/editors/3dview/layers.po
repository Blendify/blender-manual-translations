"3D scenes often become exponentially more confusing as they grow more "

" objects are lit, and does not want lights for one object to affect nearby "

"Armatures can also become very complex, with different types of bones, "
"controllers, solvers, custom shapes, and so on. Since armatures are usually "
"located close together, this can quickly become cluttered. Therefore, "
"Blender also provides layers just for armatures. Armature layers are very "
