"The creation of a 3D scene needs at least three key components: Models, "
"Materials and Lights. In this part, we will delve deeper into the creation "
"of the first of these: modeling. Modeling is the art and science of creating"
" a surface that either mimics the shape of a real-world object or expresses "
"your imagination of abstract objects."

"There are three primary types of modeling - mesh modeling, curve/surface "
"modeling, and meta modeling."

"(e.g. circle, cube, cylinder...)."

"This :doc:`Mesh Primitive </modeling/meshes/primitives>` is defined by an "
"array of points in 3D space called vertices (singular form is "
":term:`Vertex`). From there you might begin extruding faces and moving "
"vertices to create a larger, more complex shape."

"The 3D View has three principal modes that allow for the creation of, "
"editing and manipulation of the mesh models. Each of the three modes have a "
"variety of tools. Some tools may be found in one or more of the modes."

"Creation of a mesh primitive typically starts by adding a mesh object in "
"*Object Mode*. Limited types of editing such as size, location, and "
"orientation can be accomplished in *Object Mode*. *Object mode* also "
"provides the means to Join and Group multiple mesh primitives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/introduction.rst:35

"More detailed editing of the mesh model shape is done in *Edit Mode*, and "
"*Sculpt Mode*. The nature of these three modes determines the tools that are"
" available within the various panels of the 3D View. Switching between modes"
" while modeling is common. Some tools may be available in more than one mode"
" while others may be unique to a particular mode."

"Similar to curve modeling, but instead of being limited to simple linear "
"paths, they allow the creation of three dimensional surfaces, potentially "
"with volume."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/introduction.rst:47
msgid ""
"begins similarly to mesh modeling, with a base shape like a cube or sphere, "
"but instead of extruding these base shapes, these objects are clumped "
"together to form a larger object. In order to accomplish this, the metaballs"
" have a liquid-like quality, when two or more are brought together they "
"merge by smoothly rounding out the point of connection, appearing as one "
"unified object."

#: ../../manual/modeling/introduction.rst:54

"This can also be a quick way to get started with a rough shape which can be "
"converted to a mesh later."

"Since Blender functionality is :ref:`extensible via Python scripting "
