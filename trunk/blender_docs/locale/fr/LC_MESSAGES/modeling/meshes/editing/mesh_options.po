"The *X-mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you edit "
"symmetrical vertices on the other side of the mesh in a single action. When "
"you transform an element (vertex, edge or face), if there is its exact X-"
"mirrored counterpart (in local space), it will be transformed accordingly, "
"through a symmetry along the local X axis."

"When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry the "
"vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not exactly "
"positioned in their mirror locations then *X Mirror* will not treat those "
"vertices as mirrored."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh_options.rst:39

"*Topology Mirror* tries to address this problem by determining which "
"vertices are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also by "
"looking at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh Geometry. It "
"looks at the overall topology to determine if particular vertices will be "
"treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored vertices can be non-"
"symmetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored when *X Mirror* and "
"*Topology Mirror* are both active."
