"Sun Position allows positioning and animating the Sun (to a certain "
"degree of accuracy), to simulate real-world natural lighting. It uses "
"physical characteristics to position the Sun in the scene: geographic "
"location, time and date. It is based on the Earth System Research "
"Laboratory's `online calculator "
"<https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc>`__."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/lighting/sun_position.rst:33
msgid ""
"This add-on has two distinct modes of operation:  the `Normal Mode`_ "
"allows you to animate the Sun realistically, while the `Sun + HDRI "
"Texture Mode`_ is useful for synchronizing a sun light to an HDRI "
"texture."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/lighting/sun_position.rst:37
msgid "The usage mode can be selected from the top of the Sun Position panel."

msgid "Normal Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/addons/lighting/sun_position.rst:43

"This is the mode by default. After selecting the time and place, you can "

"visualization."

msgid ""
"Select the sun object which will be placed according to the chosen time "
"and place. Its position will be updated every time you change the "

msgid "Use Collection"

"It is recommended to create a collection in the scene, and to move the "
