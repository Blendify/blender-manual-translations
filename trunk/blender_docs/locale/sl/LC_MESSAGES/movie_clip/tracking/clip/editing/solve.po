"The *Create Plane Track* operator creates a new plane track. Planar "
"tracking takes advantage of the fact that there are often planar surfaces"
" in footage, by attaching markers to points on these flat planes. It can "
"be used to replace things like billboards and screens on the footage with"
" another image or video. It also might be used for masking."

"This button will create a plane object which is deforming in the same way"
" as plane defined by all selected point tracks. At least four feature "
"points tracked across the footage which belongs to the plane one wants to"

"motion."

"Feature points used to estimate plane motion could be used from any place"
" on the plane, meaning it's not necessarily need to be corners. Corners "
"are not always easy to be tracked, they might be occluded. In this case "

"Tripod Motion can be used for footage where the camera does not move and "
"only rotates. Such footage can't be tracked with a generic solver "
"approach, and it is impossible to determine the actual feature points in "
"space due to a lack of information. So this solver will solve only the "
"relative camera rotation and then reproject the feature points into a "
"sphere, with the same distance between feature and camera for all feature"
" points."
