"A Meta Strip is a strip which contain multiple strips treated as if it "
"was one strip. It allows you to reduce the vertical space used in the "
"Sequencer. You can edit it the same way as any other strips."

"It is organization tool. For example, if you are using a lot of strips "
"with complicated arrangement, you can group them together using Meta "

"To create a Meta strip, select all the strips you want to group, and "
":kbd:`Ctrl-G` to group them. The Meta strips will span from the beginning"
" of the first strip to the end of the last one, and condenses all "
"channels into a single strip."

"Separating (ungrouping) the Meta strip restores the strips to their "
"relative positions and channels. This can be used if you choose to delete"
" a Meta strip and want to keep the strips inside."

"You can edit the content inside a Meta strip by pressing :kbd:`Tab`. It "
"will expand the strip to the whole view and hide any other strips. To "
"exit the Meta strip press :kbd:`Tab` again. Meta strips can also be "
"nested, which make editing them a little confusing. To exit out one level"
" of Meta Strip make sure you do not have a Meta strips selected when you "
"press :kbd:`Tab`."

"The default blend mode for a Meta strip is Replace. There are many cases "

"One convenient use for Meta strips is when you want to apply the same "
"effect to multiple strips. For example: if you have a video that was "
"recorded in different files and want to add an effect strip. It is much "
"more convenient to apply a single set of effects to one Meta strip than "
"applying it to each individual strip."
