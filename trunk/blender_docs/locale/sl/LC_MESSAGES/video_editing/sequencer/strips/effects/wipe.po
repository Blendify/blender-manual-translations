"The wipe effect is a type of transition strip. It can be used to "
"transition from one strip to the next. The wipe will have no effect if "
"created from a single strip instead of two strips. The duration of the "
"wipe is the intersection of the two source strips and cannot be adjusted."
" To adjust the start and end of the wipe you must adjust the temporal "
"bounds of the source strips in a way that alters their intersection."
