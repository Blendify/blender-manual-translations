"The size of the outer cone of a *Spot*, which largely controls the "

msgid ""
"The *Blend* slider controls the inner cone of the *Spot*. The *Blend* "
"value can be between (0.0 to 1.0). The value is proportional and "

"the outer cone *Size*."

msgid ""
"The inner cone boundary line indicates the point at which light from the "
"*Spot* will start to blur/soften; before this point its light will mostly"
" be full strength. The larger the value of *Blend* the more blurred/soft "
"the edges of the spotlight will be, and the smaller the inner cone's "
"circular area will be (as it starts to blur/soften earlier)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make the *Spot* have a sharper falloff rate and therefore less "
"blurred/soft edges, decrease the value of *Blend*. Setting *Blend* to 0.0"
" results in very sharp spotlight edges, without any transition between "
"light and shadow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/lighting/lamps/spot.rst:64
msgid ""
"The falloff rate of the *Spot* lamp light is a ratio between the *Blend* "

"*Blend* and *Size* only control the *Spot* light cone's aperture and "

"Notice in the picture above that the object's shadow is sharp as a result"
