"A *Sun* lamp provides light of constant intensity emitted in a single "
"direction from very far away. A *Sun* lamp can be very handy for a "
"uniform clear daylight open-space illumination. In the 3D View, the *Sun*"
" light is represented by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from "
"it, plus a dashed line indicating the direction of the light."

"This direction can be changed by rotating the *Sun* lamp, like any other "
"object, but because the light is emitted in a constant direction, the "
"location of a *Sun* lamp does not affect the rendered result."
