"The Falloff allows you to control the *Strength* falloff of the brush. "
"The falloff is mapped from the center of the brush (left part of the "
"curve) towards its borders (right part of the curve). Changing the shape "
"of the curve will make the brush softer or harder. Read more about using "
"the :ref:`ui-curve-widget`."
