"Remeshing is a technique that automatically rebuilds the geometry with a "
"more uniform topology. Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of "
"topology depending on a defined resolution. This technique is especially "
"useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`, to generate "
"better topology after blocking out the initial shape."

"The Voxel Remesher uses an OpenVDB to generate a new manifold mesh from "
"the current geometry. It produces a mesh with perfectly even distributed "
"topology and it does not have any performance penalty once the new mesh "
"is calculated. This makes the voxel remesher great for sculpting has it "
"is possible to sculpt at a much higher level of detail than using other "
"features like dyntopo which often adds more performance overhead."

"The resolution or the amount of detail the remeshed mesh will have. The "
"value is used to define the size, in object space, of the :term:`Voxel`. "
"These voxels are assembled around the mesh and are used to determine the "
"new geometry. For example a value of 0.5m will create topological patches"
" that are about 0.5m (assuming *Preserve Volume* is enabled). Lower "
"values preserve finer details but will result in a mesh with a much more "
"dense topology."
