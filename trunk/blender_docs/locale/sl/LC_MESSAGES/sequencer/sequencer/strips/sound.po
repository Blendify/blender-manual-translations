"As well as images and movies the VSE can also edit audio tracks. You can "
"add Waveform Audio format ``WAV``, ``mp3`` and other audio formats files "
"from your drive, or from sound encoded within a movie, and mix them using"
" an F-Curve as a volume control."

msgid ""
"Used to pan the audio from left and right channels. Only works for mono "
"sources. Values can be between -2 and 2, where 0 means front/center, -1 "
"means to the left and 1 to the right. In case of multichannel audio (rear"
" speakers) you can pan to those with the higher values: -2, 2 is back. So"
" this value basically represents the angle at which it's played."

"To animate sound strips simply hit :kbd:`I` over any of its values. "
"Examples of animating an audio strip are to fade in/out background music "
"or to adjust volume levels. Layered/crossed sound strips are added "
"together; the lower channel does not override and cut out higher channels"
" (unlike image and video strips). This makes Blender an audio mixer. By "
"adding audio tracks and using the curves to adjust each tracks' sound "
"level, you have an automated dynamic multi-track audio mixer!"
