"It works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means that when "
"you move your mesh in the dominant direction (by default, the X axis), "
"the mesh will traverse along the curve, as if it was a train following "
"and deforming along rails. Moving the mesh perpendicularly to this axis, "
"the object will move closer or further away from the curve."
