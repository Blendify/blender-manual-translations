"Sun Beams is a 2D effect for simulating the effect of bright light "
"getting scattered in a medium `(Crepuscular Rays) "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays>`__. This phenomenon can "
"be created by renderers, but full volumetric lighting is a rather arduous"
" approach and takes a lot of render time."

"Usually, the first step is to define the area from which rays are cast. "
"Any diffuse reflected light from surfaces is not going to contribute to "
"such scattering in the real world, so should be excluded from the input "
"data. Possible ways to achieve this are:"

"node is sufficient, and physically correct because the scattered light "
"adds to the final result."
