"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the "
"X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed "
"translations along each axis, through lower and upper bounds."

"The limits for an object are calculated from its origin, and the limits "
"of a bone, from its root."

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the "
"minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in its *Transform* panel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_location.rst:18
msgid ""
"When an owner is selected and attempted to be moved outside the limit "
"boundaries, it will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when "
"rendered, but internally, its coordinates will still be changed beyond "
"the limits. If the constraint is removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump "
"to its internally specified location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_location.rst:23
msgid ""
"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the "
"limits, dragging it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing "
"until the internal coordinates are back within the limit threshold "
"(unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's "
"movement along that axis... Although this is possible, using the "
"*Transformation Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier!"
