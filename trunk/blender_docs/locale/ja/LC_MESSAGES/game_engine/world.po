"World settings enable you to set some basic effects which affect all "
"scenes throughout your game, so giving it a feeling of unity and "
"continuity. These include ambient light, depth effects (mist) and global "
"physics settings. These effects are a limited subset of the more "
"extensive range of effects available with the Blender internal or Cycles "
"renderer."

"While world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a scene, "
":doc:`compositing nodes </compositing/index>` are often preferred, though"
" more complex to master, for the additional control and options they "
"offer. For example, filtering the Z value (distance from camera) or "
"normals (direction of surfaces) through compositing nodes can further "
"increase the depth and spatial clarity of a scene."

"Light is calculated with a ray-traced method which is the same as that "
"used by Ambient Occlusion. The difference is that Environment lighting "
"takes into account the \"ambient\" parameter of the material shading "
"settings, which indicates the amount of ambient light/color that that "
"material receives."

msgid ""
"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To "

"(decreasing their Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background "
