"Path-finding in Blender is based on the concept of `navigation meshes "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh>`. Now you can create "
"navigation mesh for your level geometry directly in Blender and use it in"
" Blender Game Engine (BGE) to get your actors to find path to the target "
"and move along it. Besides path following, there are also a few other "
"steering behaviors which can be assigned to the actor: *seek* and *flee*."
" Path-finding with navigation mesh is effective for big static obstacles."
" To enable actors to avoid small dynamic objects during their movement "
"local obstacle avoidance can be used. If the obstacle simulation is "
"enabled the actor will try to choose direction which is free of collision"
" with obstacles on each frame during execution one of the steering "
"behaviors."
