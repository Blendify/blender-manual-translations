"*Text* objects are exactly what they sound like: they contain some text. "
"They share the same object type as curves and surfaces, as modern fonts "
"(OpenType, TrueType, etc.) are vectorial, made of curves (generally "
"BÃ©ziers)."

"Blender uses a \"Font System\" to manage mapping \"letter codes --> "
"objects representing them in 3D views\". This implies that not only does "
"the font system have its own *built-in* font, but it can use external "
"fonts too, including *PostScript Type 1*, *OpenType* and *TrueType* "
"fonts. And last but not least, it can use any objects existing in the "
"current blend-file as letters..."

"Texts in Blender allow you to create/render 2D or 3D text, shaded as you "
"want, with various advanced layout options (like justifying and frames), "
"as we will see below. By default, letters are just flat filled surfaces, "
"exactly like any closed 2D curve. But you can of course extrude them... "
"And texts can follow other curves."

"Of course, once you are happy with the shape of your text, you can "
"convert it (with :kbd:`Alt-C`, in *Object Mode*), either to a curve, or "
"directly to a mesh, allowing you to use all the powerful features of "
"these types of objects on it..."

"A maximum of 50000 characters is allowed per text object; however, be "
"forewarned that the more characters a single text object has, the slower "
"the object will respond interactively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see when you switch between *Object Mode* and *Edit Mode*, the"
" *Font* panel remains the same. This means that its settings can be "
"applied equally in both modes ... and this implies that you cannot apply "
"them to just a part of the mesh. So font, size, and so on, are common to "
"all letters in a *Text* object. There is just one exception: the *Bold* "
"or *Italic* buttons control properties specific to each letter (this is a"
" way to use up to four different fonts in a text)."
