"The *Area* lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-"
"like) emitter. For example, a TV screen, office neon lamps, a window, or "
"a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area lamp produces "
"shadows with soft borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the size of "
"which is defined by the user. This is in direct contrast to point-like "
"artificial lights which produce sharp borders."
