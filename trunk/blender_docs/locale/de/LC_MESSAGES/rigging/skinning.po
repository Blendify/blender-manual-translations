"We have seen in :doc:`previous pages </rigging/armatures>` how to design an "
"armature, create chains of bones, etc. Now, having a good rig is not the "
"final goal - unless you want to produce a \"Dance Macabre\" animation, "
"you'll likely want to put some flesh on your skeletons! Surprisingly, "
"\"linking\" an armature to the object(s) it should transform and/or deform "
"is called the \"skinning\" process..."

" - then, when you transform the bones in *Pose* mode, their \"children\" "

"relationship... *The \"children\" are* **never** *deformed when using this "

"</rigging/skinning/obdata>`, and then, some parts of this object to some "
"bones inside this armature. This is the more complex and powerful method, "
"and *the only way to really deform the geometry of the object*, i.e. to "
"modify its vertices/control points relative positions."
