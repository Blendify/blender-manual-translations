msgid ""
"The *Track To* constraint applies rotations to its owner, so that it always "
"points a given \"To\" axis towards its target, with another \"Up\" axis "
"permanently maintained as much aligned with the global Z axis (by default) "
"as possible. This tracking is similar to the \"billboard tracking\" in 3D "
"(see note below)."

"This is the preferred tracking constraint, as it has a more easily "

"The term \"billboard\" has a specific meaning in real-time CG programming "
"(i.e. video games!), where it is used for plane objects always facing the "
"camera (they are indeed \"trackers\", the camera being their \"target\"). "
"Their main usage is as support for tree or mist textures: if they were not "
"permanently facing the camera, you would often see your trees squeezing to "
"nothing, or your mist turning into a millefeuille paste, which would be "
"funny but not so credible."
