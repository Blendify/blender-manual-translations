"Constraints are a way of connecting *transform properties* (position, "
"rotation and scale) between objects. Constraints are in a way the object "
"counterpart of the :doc:`modifiers </modeling/modifiers/index>`, which work "
"on the object *data* (i.e. meshes, curves, etc.)."

"All constraints share a basic :doc:`common interface "
"</rigging/constraints/common_interface>`, again with many similarities with "

"Even though constraints might be very useful in static scenes (as they can "
"help to automatically position/rotate/scale objects), they were first "
"designed for animation, as they allow you to limit/control the freedom of an"
" object, either in absolute (i.e. in global space), or relatively to other "
"objects."

"Also note that constraints internally work using 4x4 transformation matrices"
" only. When you use settings for specific rotation or scaling constraining, "
"this information is being derived from the matrix only, not from settings in"
" a *Bone* or *Object*. Especially for combining rotations with non-uniform "
"or negative scaling this can lead to unpredictable behavior."

"Finally, there is a great rigging feature in Blender: in *Pose* mode, each "
"bone of an armature behaves a bit like a standard object, and, as such, can "
"be constrained. Most constraints work well with both objects and bones, but "
"there are a few exceptions which are noted in the relevant constraints "
"pages."
