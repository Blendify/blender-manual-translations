"Simple subsurface multiple scattering, for materials such as skin, wax, "
"marble, milk and others. For these materials, rather than light being "
"reflect directly off the surface, it will penetrate the surface and "
"bounce around internally before getting absorbed or leaving the surface "
"at a nearby point."

"How far the color scatters on average can be configured per RGB color "
"channel. For example, for skin, red colors scatter further, which gives "
"distinctive red-colored shadows, and a soft appearance."

"**Gaussian** gives a smoother falloff following a normal distribution, "
"which is particularly useful for more advanced materials that use "
"measured data that was fitted to one or more such Gaussian functions. The"
" function is e :sup:`-8x`:sup:`2`:sup:`/radius`:sup:`2`, such that the "
"radius roughly matches the maximum falloff distance. To match a given "
"measured variance v, set radius = sqrt(16*v)."

"How much of the texture will be blurred along with the lighting, mixing "
"the texture at the incoming and outgoing points on the surface. Note that"
" the right choice depends on the texture. Consider for example a texture "
"created from a photograph of skin, in this cases the colors will already "
"be pre-blurred and texture blur could be set to 0. Even for hand painted "
"textures no or minimal blurring might be appropriate, as a texture artist"
" would likely paint in softening already, one would usually not even know"
" what an unblurred skin texture looks like, we always see it blurred. For"
" a procedural texture on the other hand this option would likely have a "
"higher value."
