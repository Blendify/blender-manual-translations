"This projection is compatible with the environment texture as used for world"
" shaders, so it can be used to render an environment map. To match the "
"default mapping, set the camera object rotation to (90, 0, -90) or pointing "
"along the positive X-axis. This corresponds to looking at the center of the "
"image using the default environment texture mapping."

msgid ""
"Fisheye lenses are typically wide angle lenses with strong distortion, "
"useful for creating panoramic images for e.g. dome projection, or as an "
"artistic effect. The *Fisheye Equisolid* lens will best match real cameras. "
"It provides a lens focal length and field of view angle, and will also take "
"the sensor dimensions into account."

"The *Fisheye Equidistant* lens does not correspond to any real lens model; "
"it will give a circular fish-eye that doesn't take any sensor information "
"into account but rather uses the whole sensor. This is a good lens for full "
"dome projection."
