"For anyone creating motion graphics or simple text overlays, overscan is "
"an important consideration. Although its origins are rooted in historic "
"analog TV systems, unfortunately even in 2017, for various reasons it can"
" still be an issue with modern digital flatscreen TVs."

msgid ""
"Due to various limitations in analog TV equipment, the displayed image "
"could sometimes end up shifted horizontally or vary in size, which could "
"lead to the area beyond the intended visible picture being shown. This "
"hidden area sometimes contained junk noise, timing signals or closed-"
"caption/subtitle data. To avoid this being visible to the viewer, the "
"standard approach for TV manufacturers was to 'overscan' (zoom in) the "
"displayed picture by a small amount (between 5-10% edge crop) to ensure "
"that at no time would the hidden areas be visible."

msgid ""
"Although modern digital electronics have eliminated the issue of shifting"
" image position, unfortunately, some TV manufacturers have included "
"overscan on their flatscreen TVs. Why? Because for many years it was "
"given that the edge of the visible image would rarely be seen, so "
"broadcasters would sometimes overlay 'hidden' data to the very edge of "
"the image (e.g. some types of closed captions). Also, legacy analog "
"recordings might still contain unwanted noise around the edge. To avoid "
"consumer complaints, overscan is quite often enabled by default. For some"
" flatscreen TVs, it is not possible to disable it."

"Blender has configurable safe-area markings which can be made visible by "
"selecting the scene camera, then in the camera settings by enabling "
":ref:`Safe Areas <camera-safe-areas>`. Several presets are available. If "
"you are producing work for a television network or indeed any client, "

msgid ""
"When exporting to many of the common video formats, the rendered RGB(A) "
"images go through a conversion process whereby they are translated to the"
" YCbCr color model. Y corresponds to a grayscale representation of the "
"image, Cb and Cr contain data for the blue and red channels respectively."
" Green is encoded into the Y and Cb, Cr channels with some clever math."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/output/video.rst:58
msgid ""
"Importantly, the color components are often stored at a lower resolution "
"to the Y (grayscale) channel. This can cause blurring/smearing which can "
"be a problem with small text and some saturated color combinations -- so "
"it is well worth doing test encodes to make sure that text remains "
"legible. As with safe areas, a TV network or client might have their own "
"rules on minimum text size and positioning, so always seek clarification "
"when unsure."
