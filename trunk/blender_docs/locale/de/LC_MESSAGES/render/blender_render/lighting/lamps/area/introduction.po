"The *Area* lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-like)"
" emitter. For example, a TV screen, your supermarket's neon lamps, a window,"
" or a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area lamp produces "
"shadows with soft borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the size of which "
"is defined by the user. This is in direct contrast to point-like artificial "
"lights which produce sharp borders."

"Choosing the appropriate shape for your *Area* light will enhance the "

"*Rectangular* area lamp in a window (vertical) or from neons (horizontal) "
"with proper ratios for *Size X* and *Size Y*. For the simulation of the "
"light emitted by a TV screen a vertical *Square* area lamp would be better "
