#~ "When adding a Scene strip, please note that, in order to show you the strip "

#~ "computer may have a different set."

#~ "Every Built-in effect is explained in the next page individually, but they "
#~ "all are added and controlled in the same way. To add an effect strip, select"
#~ " one base strip (image, movie, or scene) by :kbd:`RMB` clicking on it. For "
#~ "some effects, like the Cross transition effect, you will need to "
#~ ":kbd:`Shift-RMB` a second overlapping strip (it depends on the effect you "
#~ "want). Then select Add --> Effect and pick the effect you want from the pop-"
#~ "up menu. When you do, the Effect strip will be shown above the source "
#~ "strips. If it is an independent effect, like the color generator (described "
#~ "later), it will be rubberbanded to your mouse; click to drop the strip."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Since most Effects strips depend on one or two source strips, their frame "

#~ "To use an effect that combines or makes a transition between (or composites)"
