"The *Multiply* effect multiplies two colors. Blender uses values between "
"**0.0** and **1.0** for the colors, he doesn't have to normalise this "
"operation, the multiplication of two terms between **0.0** and **1.0** "
"always gives a result between **0.0** and **1.0** (with the 'traditional' "
"representation with three bytes - like RGB(**124**, **255**, **56**) -, the "
"multiplications give far too high results - like RGB(**7316**, **46410**, "
"**1848**) -, that have to be 'brought back', normalised - just by dividing "
"them by **256** ! - to 'go back' to range of **0** to **255** ...). **256** "
"! - to 'go back' to range of **0** to **255** ...)."

"A mask is a B&W picture witch, after multiplication with a 'normal' image, "
"only show this one in the white areas of the mask (everything else is "
"black). The opening title sequence to James Bond movies, where the camera is"
" looking down the barrel of a gun at James, is a good example of this "
"effect."

"Multiplying a color with a 'normal' image allows you to soften some hues of "
"this one (and so - symmetrically - to enhance the others). For example, if "
"you have a brown pixel RGB(**0.50**, **0.29**, **0.05**), and you multiply "
"it with a cyan filter (uniform color RGB(**0.0**, **1.0**, **1.0**), you'll "
"get a color RGB(**0.0**, **0.29**, **0.5**). Visually, the result is to kill"
" the reds and bring up (by 'symmetry' - the real values remain unchanged!) "
"the blues an greens. Physically, it is the same effect as shining a cyan "
"light onto a chocolate bar. Emotionally, vegetation becomes more lush, water"
" becomes more Caribbean and inviting, skies become friendlier."

"This effect reduces the global luminosity of the picture (the result will "
"always be smaller than the smallest operand). If one of the image is all "
"white, the result is the other picture; if one of the image is all black, "
"the result is all black!"
