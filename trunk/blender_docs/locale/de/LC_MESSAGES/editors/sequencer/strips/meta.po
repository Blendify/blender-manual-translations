"Meta-Strips are a kind of organization tool. For example, if you are using a"
" lot of strips and they are complicated the the interface you can group them"
" together using Meta-Strips. A Meta-Strip spans from the beginning of the "
"first strip to the end of the last one, and condenses all channels into a "
"single strip. Separating (ungrouping) them restores them to their relative "
"positions and channels. To create a Meta-Strip select all the strips you "
"want to group, and :kbd:`Ctrl-G` to group them. If you choose to delete a "
"Meta-Strip and want to keep the strips inside, use :kbd:`Alt-G`."

"After creating a Meta-Strip it is also possible to edit the contents inside "
"a Meta-Strip. To do this select the desired Meta-strip and press :kbd:`Tab`."
" Once you are done editing the contents inside a Meta-Strip press :kbd:`Tab`"
" again to exit the Meta-Strip. Meta-Strips can also be nested, which make "
"editing them a little confusing. To exit out one level of Meta-Strip make "
"sure you do not have a Meta-Strip selected when you press :kbd:`Tab`."

"One convenient use for Meta-Strips is when you want to apply the same effect"
" to multiple strips. For example: if you have a video that was recorded in "
"different files and want to add an effect strip. It is much more convenient "
"to apply a single set of effects to one Meta-Strip then applying it to each "
"individual strip."
