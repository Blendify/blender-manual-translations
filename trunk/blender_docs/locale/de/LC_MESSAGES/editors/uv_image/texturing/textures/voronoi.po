"The *Minkovsky* setting has a user definable value (the *Exponent* button) "

"``(x``:sup:`e` ``+ y``:sup:`e` ``+ z``:sup:`e` ``)``:sup:`1/e`. A value of "
"one produces the *Manhattan* distance metric, a value less than one produces"
" stars (at **0.5**, it gives a *Minkovsky 1/2*), and higher values produce "
"square cells (at **4.0**, it gives a *Minkovsky 4*, at **10.0**, a "
"*Chebychev*). So nearly all Distance Settings are basically the same - "
