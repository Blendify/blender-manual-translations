"Conceptually, grouping nodes allows you to specify a *set* of nodes that "

"As an example:  If you have created a material that you would like to use"
" with different inputs e.g. diffuse color: red plastic, green plastic. "
"You could create different materials with *Make Single User* for each "
"different color with a copy of the tree part describing the plastic "
"material. If you like to edit the material you would need to redo the "
"edit on all materials. A better method of re-use is to create node "

" the name of the node group to something meaningful. When appending node "
"groups from one blend file to another, Blender does not make a "
"distinction between material node groups or composite node groups, so it "
"is recommended some naming convention, that will allow you to easily "
"distinguish between the two types."
