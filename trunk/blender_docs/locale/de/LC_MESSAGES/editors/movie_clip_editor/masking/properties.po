"Mask layers consists of one or several splines and used to \"grouped\" "

"define how the splines interact with each other. Splines belonging to the"
" same layer can be animated together, for example by an item from motion "
"tracker footage. Example of such tools might be parenting the whole set "
"of splines to single motion tracking data or simple to transform all of "

"The purpose of mask layers can be explained with an example. Suppose "

"At the point of intersection of these shapes they will be added together "
"rather than creating a hole, as would happen if they were on the same "
"layer. If the motion is simple enough, a single motion tracked point can "
"be used to drive the location of the entire mask layer."
