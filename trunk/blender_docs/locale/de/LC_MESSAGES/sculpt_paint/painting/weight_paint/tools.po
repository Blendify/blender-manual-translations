"Ensures that all deforming vertex groups add up to one while painting. "
"When this option is turned off, then all weights of a vertex can have any"

"Deform Groups for character animation then Blender always interprets the "
"weight values relative to each other. That is, Blender always does a "

"This option is only useful in the Armature tab, where you can select "
"multiple Vertex Groups by selecting multiple Pose bones. Once at least "
"two Vertex Groups are selected, viewport colors and paint logic switch to"
" Multi-Paint Mode, using the sum of the selected groups' weights if Auto "
"Normalize is enabled, and the average otherwise. Any paint operations "
"aimed at this collective weight are applied to individual Vertex Group "
"weights in such way that their ratio stays the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/tools.rst:96
msgid ""
"Since the ratio is undefined if all weights are zero, Multi-Paint cannot "
"operate on vertices that do not have any weight assigned to the relevant "
"Vertex Groups. For this reason it also does not allow reducing the weight"
" all the way to zero. When used with X-Mirror, it only guarantees "
"completely a symmetrical result if weights are initially symmetrical."

"While Multi-Paint cannot directly paint on zero-weight vertices, it is "

"To do that, enable vertex selection, select target vertices, and apply "
"one iteration of the tool using vertex groups from *Selected Pose Bones* "
