"The Time node generates a *fac* tor value (from 0.00 to 1.00) (that changes "
"according to the curve drawn) as time progresses through your movie "
"(frames)."

"The *Start* and *End* NumButtons specify the range of time the values should"
" be output along, and this range becomes the X-axis of the graph. The curve "
"defines the Y-value and hence the factor that is output. In the example to "
"the right, since the timespan is 250 frames and the line is straight from "
"corner to corner, 0.50 would be output at frame 125, and 0.75 will be output"
" at frame 187."

"The :doc:`Map Value </composite_nodes/types/vector/map_value>` node can be "
"used to map the output to a more appropriate value. With some time curves, "
"it is possible that the Time node may output a number larger than one or "
"less than zero. To be safe, use the Min/Max clamping function of the Map "
"Value node to limit output."

"You can reverse time (unfortunately, only in Blender and not in the real "
"world) by specifying a Start frame greater than the End frame. The net "
"effect of doing so is to flip the curve around. Warning: doing so is easily "
"overlooked in your node map and can be very confusing (like meeting your "
"mother when she was/is your age in \"Back to the Future\")."

"In Blender, time is measured in frames. The actual duration of a time span "
"depends on how fast those frames whiz by (frame rate). You set the frame "
"rate in your animation settings (:ref:`Render Dimensions Panel "
"<render_output_dimensions>`). Common settings range from 5 seconds per frame"
" for slideshows (0.2 fps), to 30 fps for US movies."

"Common uses for this include a :doc:`\"fade to black\" "
"</composite_nodes/types/converter/set_alpha>`, wherein the accelerate time "
"curve (typically exponentially-shaped) feeds a mix value that mixes a "
"constant black color in, so that the blackness accelerates and eventually "
"darkens the image to total black. Other good uses include an increasing "
"soften (blur-out or -in) effect, or :doc:`fade-in "

"As your imagination runs wild, consider a few ideas that came to me just now"
" on my couch: mixing a clouds texture with a time input to fog up a piece of"
" glass or show spray paint building up on a wall. Consider mixing red and "
"the soften with time (decreasing output) to show what someone sees when "
"waking up from a hard hit on the head. Mix HSV input with a starfield image "
"with time (decreasing output) to show what we might see someday as we "
"accelerate our starship and experience red-shift."

"As a user, you should know that we have arrived at the point where there are"
" many ways to do the same thing in Blender. For example, an old way to make "
"a slide show using Blender, you created multiple image textures, one image "
"for each slide, and assigned them as texture channels to the material for "
"the screen, then created a screen (plane) that filled the cameral view. "
"Using a material ipo, you would adjust the Color influence of each channel "
"at different frames, fading one in as the previous slide faded out. Whew! "
"Rearranging slide and changing the timing was clunky but doable by moving "
"the IPO keys. The *Node* way is to create an image input, one for each slide"
" image. Using the Image input and Time nodes connected to an AlphaOver mixer"
" is much simpler, clearer, and easier to maintain."
