"The Bilateral Blur node performs a high quality adaptive blur on the source "
"image. It can be used for various purposes like: smoothing results from "
"blenders raytraced ambient occlusion smoothing results from various unbiased"
" renderers, to fake some performance-heavy processes, like blurry "
"refractions/reflections, soft shadows, to make non-photorealistic "
"compositing effects."

"if only 1st input is connected, the node blurs the image depending on the "
"edges present in the source image. If the Determinator is connected, it "
"serves as the source for defining edges/borders for the blur in the image. "
"This has great advantage in case the source image is too noisy, but normals "
"in combination with zbuffer can still define exact borders/edges of objects."
