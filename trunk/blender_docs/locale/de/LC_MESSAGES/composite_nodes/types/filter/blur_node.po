"The Blur node blurs an image, using one of seven blur modes (set using the "
"upper-left pop-up button), and a radius defined by the X and Y number "
"buttons. By default these are set to zero, so to enable the node you must "
"set one or both to a value greater than 0. You can optionally connect a "
"value image to the Size input node, to control the blur radius with a mask. "
"The values must be mapped between 0-1 for best effect, as they will be "
"multiplied with the X and Y number button values."

"The Bokeh button (only visible as Bok or Bo on some screen setups) will "
"force the blur node to use a circular blur filter. This gives higher quality"
" results, but is slower then using a normal filter. The Gam button (for "
"\"gamma\") makes the Blur node gamma-correct the image before blurring it."

"An example blend file, in fact the one used to create the image above, `is "
"available here. <http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Media:Manual-Node-"
"Blur.blend>`__ The .blend file takes one image from the RenderLayer "
"\"Blurs\" and blurs it while offsetting it (Translate) and then combining it"
" (AlphaOver) to build up the progressive sequence of blurs. Play with the "
"Value and Multiply nodes to change the amount of blurring that each "
"algorithm does."
