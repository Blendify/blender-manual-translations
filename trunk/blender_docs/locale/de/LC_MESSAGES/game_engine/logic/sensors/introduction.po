"Sensors are the logic bricks that cause the logic to do anything. Sensors "
"give an output when something happens, e.g. a trigger event such as a "
"collision between two objects, a key pressed on the keyboard, or a timer for"
" a timed event going off. When a sensor is triggered, a positive pulse is "
"sent to all controllers that are linked to it."
