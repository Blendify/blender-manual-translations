"Bullet Physics provides collision detection and rigid body dynamics for "
"the Blender Game Engine. It takes some settings from Blender that "
"previously were designed for the former collision detection system "
"(called Sumo)."

"Since this API is not well documented, it can be unclear what kind of "
"values to use for setting parameters. In general, damping settings should"
" be in the range of 0 to 1 and stiffness settings should not be much "
