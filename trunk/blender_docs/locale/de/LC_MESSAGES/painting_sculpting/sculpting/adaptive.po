msgid ""
"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "
"method, adds and removes details on the fly. Dyntopo is quick, just get a"
" brush and start to sculpt. Dyntopo will add details base upon your brush"
" size, detail type and strength."

msgid "Detail Type"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:14
msgid ""
"Dyntopo uses three different detail methods to create dynamic detail to "
"an object. The methods available are Relative Detail (Default), Constant "
"Detail, and Brush Detail."

msgid "Relative Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:18
msgid ""
"This method uses a detail size based on the number of pixels, and in turn"
" will create topology in that size. Zoom out big details, zoom in small "
"fines details."

msgid "Constant Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:22
msgid ""
"To keep detail uniform across the entire object, Constant Detail can be "
"used. The Detail is based on the percentage of a single BU (Blender "
"Unit)."

msgid "Brush Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:26
msgid ""
"Giving more control over the topology, with this method you can create "
"topology based on the brush size. You can increase and lower topology by "
"simply resizing the brush itself. The detail size is based the size of "
"the brush itself, where 100% will create topology the size of the brush "
"ring itself."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:36
msgid ""
"When using Dynamic Topology, a certain method will be used to tell how "

msgid "Subdivide"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:41

"Just like the subdivide command, this method will only subdivide topology"

msgid "Collapse"
msgstr ""

"When topology is too dense, and is smaller than the detail given, edges "

"Uses direction orientation to symmetrize. Since Dyntopo adds details "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:67
msgid ""
"The multires modifier is needed to sculpt. The modifier will subdivide "
"the mesh. The more subdivision the more computing will be needed. With "
"the Blender stack no-destructive data, multires sculpting will help when "
"you have a clean topology base mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/painting_sculpting/sculpting/adaptive.rst:71
msgid ""
"When sculpting with multires we have the ability sculpt in different "
"level of subdivision, this mean we can sculpt some details in subdivision"
" level 1 and add more details in subdivision 2 and go back to subdivision"
" 1 correct some mistakes. While this workflow is often used, multires "
"modifier has some limitations. You may end up with some mesh distortions."
" As an advice, add as more details as possible before adding more "
"subdivisions. Clay brush, SculptDraw work better with multires sculpting "
"to sculpt secondary forms."
