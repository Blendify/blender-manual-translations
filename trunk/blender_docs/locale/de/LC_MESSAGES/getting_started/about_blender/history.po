"In 1988 Ton Roosendaal co-founded the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo. NeoGeo "
"quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands and one "
"of the leading animation houses in Europe. NeoGeo created award-winning "
"productions (European Corporate Video Awards 1993 and 1995) for large "
"corporate clients such as multi-national electronics company Philips. "
"Within NeoGeo Ton was responsible for both art direction and internal "
"software development. After careful deliberation Ton decided that the "
"current in-house 3D toolset for NeoGeo was too old and cumbersome to "
"maintain, and needed to be rewritten from scratch. In 1995 this rewrite "
"began and was destined to become the 3D software creation we all know as "
"Blender. As NeoGeo continued to refine and improve Blender it became "
"apparent to Ton that Blender could be used as a tool for other artists "
"outside of NeoGeo."

"In 1998, Ton decided to found a new company called Not a Number (NaN) as a "
"spin-off of NeoGeo to further market and develop Blender. At the core of "
"NaN was a desire to create and distribute a compact, cross platform 3D "
"application for free. At the time this was a revolutionary concept as most "
"commercial 3D applications cost thousands of dollars. NaN hoped to bring "
"professional level 3D modeling and animation tools within the reach of the "
"general computing public. NaN's business model involved providing "
"commercial products and services around Blender. In 1999 NaN attended its "
"first SIGGRAPH conference in an effort to more widely promote Blender. "
"Blender's first SIGGRAPH convention was a huge success and gathered a "
"tremendous amount of interest from both the press and attendees. Blender "
"was a hit and its huge potential confirmed!"

"Following the success of the SIGGRAPH conference in early 2000, NaN secured "
"financing of €4.5M from venture capitalists. This large inflow of cash "
"enabled NaN to rapidly expand its operations. Soon NaN boasted as many as "
"fifty employees working around the world trying to improve and promote "
"Blender. In the summer of 2000, Blender 2.0 was released. This version of "
"Blender added the integration of a game engine to the 3D application. By "
"the end of 2000, the number of users registered on the NaN website "
"surpassed 250,000."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, NaN's ambitions and opportunities didn't match the company's "
"capabilities and the market realities of the time. This over-extension "
"resulted in restarting NaN with new investor funding and a smaller company "
"in April 2001. Six months later NaN's first commercial software product, "
"Blender Publisher was launched. This product was targeted at the emerging "
"market of interactive web-based 3D media. Due to disappointing sales and "
"the ongoing difficult economic climate, the new investors decided to shut "
"down all NaN operations. The shutdown also included discontinuing the "
"development of Blender. Although there were clearly shortcomings in the "
"then current version of Blender, such as a complex internal software "
"architecture, unfinished features and a non-standard way of providing the "
"GUI, the enthusiastic support from the user community and customers who had "
"purchased Blender Publisher in the past meant that Ton couldn't justify "
"leaving Blender to fade into insignificance. Since restarting a company "
"with a sufficiently large team of developers wasn't feasible, Ton "
"Roosendaal founded the non-profit organization Blender Foundation in March "
"2002."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Blender Foundation's primary goal was to find a way to continue "
"developing and promoting Blender as a community-based `open source <http://"
"www.opensource.org/>`__ project. In July 2002, Ton managed to get the NaN "
"investors to agree to a unique Blender Foundation plan to attempt to "
"release Blender as open source. The \"Free Blender\" campaign sought to "
"raise €100,000 so that the Foundation could buy the rights to the Blender "
"source code and intellectual property rights from the NaN investors and "
"subsequently release Blender to the open source community. With an "
"enthusiastic group of volunteers, among them several ex-NaN employees, a "
"fund raising campaign was launched to \"Free Blender\". To everyone's "
"surprise and delight the campaign reached the €100,000 goal in only seven "
"short weeks. On Sunday October 13, 2002, Blender was released to the world "
"under the terms of the `GNU GPL <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl>`__. "
"Blender development continues to this day driven by a team of dedicated "
"volunteers from around the world led by Blender's original creator, Ton "
"Roosendaal."
