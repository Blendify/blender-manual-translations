"All regions of this object that are inside the domain bounding box will be "

"object inside the domain, they should currently not intersect. Also make "
"sure the surface normals are pointing outwards. In contrast to domain "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for fluid objects."

"Blender uses the orientation of the Surface Normals to determine what is "
"\"inside of\" the Fluid object and what is \"outside\". You want all of the "
"normals to face *outside* (in *Edit mode*, use :kbd:`Ctrl-N` or press "
":kbd:`Spacebar` and choose *Edit*?? *Normals*?? *Calculate Outside*). If the"
" normals face the wrong way, you'll be rewarded with a \"gigantic flood of "
"water\" because Blender will think that the volume of the object is outside "
"of its mesh! This applies regardless of the *Volume init* type setting."
