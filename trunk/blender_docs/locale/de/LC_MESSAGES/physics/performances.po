"Often you will encounter suboptimal baking performance with openMP (OMP) "
"multithreaded simulations, especially fluids."

"This is due how the domain splitting distributes threads to cells which are "
"sometimes not \"filled\" whereas calculations, resulting in lot of threads "
"not giving any speedboost. This is almost dependent on the resolution the "
"simulation and object density."

"If you have such an \"undersaturated\" simulation, it helps a lot to just "
"reduce the OMP threads to a low number instead of letting OMP just use all "
"available cores."
