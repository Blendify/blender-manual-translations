"The *X-mirror* option of the *Mesh Options* panel allows you edit both "
"\"sides\" of your mesh in a single action. When you transform an element "
"(vertex, edge or face), if there is its *exact X-mirrored counterpart* (in "
"local space), it will be transformed accordingly, *through a symmetry along "

"When using the *X Mirror* option to work on mirrored Mesh Geometry the "
"vertices that are mirrored must be perfectly placed. If they are not exactly"
" positioned in their mirror locations then *X Mirror* will not treat those "
"vertices as mirrored. This can be annoying because often the out of position"
" vertices are only very slightly out of position."

"*Topology Mirror* tries to solve this problem by determining which vertices "
"are mirrored vertices not only by using their positions but also by looking "
"at how those vertices are related to others in the Mesh Geometry. It looks "
"at the overall Mesh Geometry topology to determine if particular vertices "
"will be treated as mirrored. The effect of this is that mirrored vertices "
"can be non-symetrical and yet still be treated as mirrored when *X Mirror* "
"and *Topology Mirror* are both active."
