msgid ""
"An object or bone can be scaled along the X, Y and Z axes. This "
"constraint restricts the amount of allowed scalings along each axis, "
"through lower and upper bounds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_scale.rst:13
msgid ""
"This constraint does not tolerate negative scale values (those you might "
"use to mirror an object...): when you add it to an object or bone, even "
"if no axis limit is enabled, nor the *For Transform* button, as soon as "
"you scale your object, all negative scale values are instantaneously "
"inverted to positive ones... And the boundary settings can only take "
"strictly positive values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_scale.rst:20
msgid ""
"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered scale of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have scale values outside the "
"minimum and maximum ranges (as long as they remain positive!). This can "
"be seen in its *Transform* panel. When an owner is scaled and attempted "
"to be moved outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those"
" boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, its coordinates "
"will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, "
"its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally-specified scale."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_scale.rst:30
msgid ""
"Similarly, if its owner has an internal scale that is beyond the limits, "
"scaling it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the "
"internal scale values are back within the limit threshold (unless you "
"enabled the *For Transform* option, see below, or your owner has some "
"negative scale values)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/constraints/transform/limit_scale.rst:35
msgid ""
"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis locks the owner's scaling"
" along that axis. Although this is possible, using the *Transformation "
"Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier."

"These buttons enable the lower boundary for the scale of the owner along "
"respectively the X, Y and Z axes of the chosen *Space*. The *Min* and "
"*Max* numeric fields to their right control the value of their lower and "
"upper boundaries, respectively."

"If a min value is higher than its corresponding max value, the constraint"

msgid ""
"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, and except for "
"the negative values, the owner can still have scales out of bounds (as "
"shown by the *Transform* panel). Well, when you enable this button, this "
"is no longer possible, the owner transform properties are also limited by"
" the constraint. Note however, that the constraint does not directly "
"modify the scale values: you have to scale its owner one way or another "
"for this to take effect."
