"Blender treats the bone as a section of a Bézier curve passing through "

"this invisible curve representing a tessellated point of the Bézier "
"curve. The control points at each end of the curve are the endpoints of "
"the bone. The shape of the B-Bones can be controlled using a series of "
"properties or indirectly through the neighboring bones (i.e. first child "
