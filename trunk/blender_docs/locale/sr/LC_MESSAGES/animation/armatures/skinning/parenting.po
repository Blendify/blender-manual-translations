"*With Automatic Weights* parenting works similar to *With Empty Groups*, "
"but it will not leave the vertex groups empty. It calculates how much "
"influence a particular bone would have on vertices based on the distance "
"from those vertices to a particular bone (\"bone heat\" algorithm). This "
"influence will be assigned as weights in the vertex groups."

"This method of parenting is certainly easier to setup, but it can often "
"lead to armatures which do not deform child objects in ways you would "
"want. Overlaps can occur when it comes to determining which bones should "
"influence certain vertices when calculating influences for more complex "
"armatures and child objects. Symptoms of this confusion are that when "
"transforming the armature in *Pose Mode*, parts of the child objects do "
"not deform as you expect; If Blender does not give you the results you "
"require, you will have to manually alter the weights of vertices in "
"relation to the vertex groups they belong to and have influence in."

"Works in a similar way to *With Automatic Weights*. The difference is "
"that the influences are calculated based on the :ref:`Bone Envelopes "
"<armature-bones-envelope>` settings. It will assign a weight to each "
