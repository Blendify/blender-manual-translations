msgid ""
"Using the alpha (transparency channel), this effect composites a result "
"based on transparent areas of the dominant image. If you use a Scene "
"strip, the areas of the image where there is not anything solid are "
"transparent; they have an alpha value of 0. If you use a movie strip, "
"that movie has an alpha value of 1 (completely opaque)."

"So, you can use the *Alpha Over* / *Alpha Under* effect to composite the "
"CGI Scene on top of your movie. The result is your model doing whatever "
"as if it was part of the movie. The :menuselection:`Adjust --> "
"Compositing --> Opacity` controls how much the foreground is mixed over "
"the background, fading in the foreground on top of the background. The "
"colors of transparent foreground image areas are ignored and do not "
"change the color of the background."

"The Alpha Over Drop effect is much like the Cross, but puts preference to"
" the top or second image, giving more of a gradual overlay effect than a "
"blend like the Cross does. Of course, all of the Alpha effects respect "
