"Blender's animations are by default rendered as a sequence of *perfectly "
"still* images. While great for stop-motion and time-lapses, this is "
"unrealistic, since fast-moving objects do appear to be blurred in the "
"direction of motion, both in a movie frame and in a photograph from a "
"real-world camera."
