"Perform the actual fluid simulation. Blender will continue to work "

"This is similar to the animation output settings, only selecting a file "
"is a bit special: when you select any of the previously generated surface"
" meshes (e.g. ``test1_fluidsurface_final_0132.bobj.gz``), the prefix will"
" be automatically set (``test1_`` in this example). This way the "
"simulation can be done several times with different settings, and allows "
"quick changes between the different sets of surface data."

"The fluid simulator disregards the *Start* setting in the *Animation* "

"Manually entering (or searching for) a previously saved (baked) "

"If the mesh has modifiers, the rendering settings are used for exporting "
"the mesh to the fluid solver. Depending on the setting, calculation times"
" and memory use might exponentially increase. For example, when using a "
"moving mesh with *Subdivision Surface* as an obstacle, it might help to "
"decrease simulation time by switching it off, or to a low subdivision "
"level. When the setup/rig is correct, you can always increase settings to"
" yield a more realistic result."
