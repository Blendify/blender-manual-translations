#~ msgid "Pattern"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Can be used to disable displaying "
#~ "of rectangles which correspond to "
#~ "pattern areas of tracks. In some "
#~ "cases it helps to make the clip"
#~ " view cleaner to check how good "
#~ "tracking is."

#~ msgid "Search :kbd:`Alt-S`"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Can be used to disable displaying "
#~ "of rectangles which correspond to search"
#~ " areas of tracks. In some cases "
#~ "it helps to make the clip view "
#~ "cleaner to check how good tracking "
#~ "is. Only search areas for selected "
#~ "tracks will be displayed."

#~ "And *Length* control displaying of the"
#~ " paths of tracks. The ways tracks "
#~ "are moving can be visible looking "
#~ "at only one frame. It helps to "
#~ "determine if a track jumps from "
#~ "its position or not."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Show Disabled :kbd:`Alt-D`"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Makes it possible to hide all "
#~ "tracks which are disabled on the "
#~ "current frame. This helps to make "
#~ "view more clear, to see if "
#~ "tracking is happening accurately enough."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Info"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Displays information such as track name"
#~ " and status of the track (if it"
#~ " is keyframed, disabled, tracked or "
#~ "estimated). Names and status for "
#~ "selected tracks are displayed."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "3D Markers"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Makes sense after solving the movie "
#~ "clip, and it works in the "
#~ "following way: the solved position of"
#~ " each track gets projected back to"
#~ " the movie clip and displayed as "
#~ "a small point. The color of the"
#~ " point depends on the distance "
#~ "between the projected coordinate and the"
#~ " original coordinate: if they are "
#~ "close enough, the point is green, "
#~ "otherwise it will be red. This "
#~ "helps to find tracks which were "
#~ "not solved nicely and need to be"
#~ " tweaked."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Draw Thin"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The way in which markers are "
#~ "displayed compact (black outline and "
#~ "yellow foreground color) makes tracks "
#~ "visible on all kind of footage "
#~ "(both dark and light). But sometimes "
#~ "it can be annoying and this option"
#~ " will make the marker display more"
#~ " compactly -- the outline is replaced"
#~ " by dashed black lines drawn on "
#~ "top of the foreground, so that "
#~ "marker areas are only 1px thick."
