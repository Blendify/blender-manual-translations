"Blender's toon shaders can give your rendering a comic-book-like or manga-"
"like appearance, affecting the shades of colors. The effect is not perfect "
"since real comics and manga also usually have china ink outlines. Blender "

"The threshold of the angle between faces for drawing edges, from 0 to 255. A"
" value of 10 would just give outline of object against the background, "
"whereas higher settings start to add outlines on surface edges, starting "
"with sharper angles. At maximum intensity, Edge will even faintly display "
"geometry subsurf edge lines in areas of imperfect smoothing."

"It is possible to separate out the edge layer using a render layer dedicated"
" to that purpose. The alpha channel is 0 where there is no edge, and 1 where"
" the edge is. By separating out the edge layer, you can blur it, change its "
"color, mask it, etc. The image to the right shows how to do this. I created "
"an Edge render layer that only has the Sky and Edge layers (I included sky "
"so that we get the world color later on in the composite output). The other "
"render layer omits the Edge layer, so it returns just the normal image. On "
"the output panel I enabled Edge with a width of 10 in black. I run that "
"layer through a blur node. Using the Alphaover node, I then composite the "
"cube on top of the blurred edge. The result gives a soft-shadow kind of "
"effect. Note that Premultiply is set because the Edge image already has an "
"alpha of 1.0 set."
