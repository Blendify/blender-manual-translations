"Next to lighting from the background and any object with an emission shader,"
" lamps are another way to add light into the scene. The difference is that "
"they are not directly visible in the rendered image, and can be more easily "
"managed as objects of their own type."

msgid ""
"Currently *Point*, *Spot*, *Area* and *Sun* lamps are supported. *Hemi* "
"lamps are not supported, and will be rendered as point and sun lamps "
"respectively, but they may start working in the future, so it's best not to "
"enable them to preserve compatibility."

msgid ""
"By disabling this option, light from lamps will not be blocked by objects "
"in-between. This can speed up rendering by not having to trace rays to the "
"light source."

msgid "Point Lamp"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:31
msgid ""
"Point lamps emit light equally in all directions. By setting the *Size* "
"larger than zero, they become spherical lamps, which give softer shadows and"
" shading. The strength of point lamps is specified in Watts."

msgid "Spot Lamp"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:39
msgid ""
"Spot lamps emit light in a particular direction, inside a cone. By setting "
"the *Size* larger than zero, they can cast softer shadows and shading. The "
"size parameter defines the size of the cone, while the blend parameter can "
"soften the edges of the cone."

msgid "Light Portals"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:53
msgid ""
"Area lamps can also function as light portals to help sample the environment"
" light, and significantly reduce noise in interior scenes. Note that "
"rendering with portals is usually slower, but as it converges more quickly, "
"less samples are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:57
msgid ""
"Light portals work by enabling the Portal option, and placing areas lamps in"
" windows, door openings, and any place where light will enter the interior."

msgid "Sun Lamp"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:64
msgid ""
"Sun lamps emit light in a given direction. Their position is not taken into "
"account; they are always located outside of the scene, infinitely far away, "
"and will not result in any distance falloff."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/lamps.rst:68
msgid ""
"Because they are not located inside the scene, their strength uses different"
" units, and should typically be set to lower values than other lights."
