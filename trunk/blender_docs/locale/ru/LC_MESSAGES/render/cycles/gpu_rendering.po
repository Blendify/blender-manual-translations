":abbr:`GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)` rendering makes it possible to use"
" your graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up "
"rendering, because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number "
"crunching. On the other hand, they also have some limitations in "
"rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory, and issues with "
"interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and "
"rendering."

msgid "Why is Blender unresponsive during rendering?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:74
msgid ""
"While a graphics card is rendering, it can not redraw the user interface,"
" which makes Blender unresponsive. We attempt to avoid this problem by "
"giving back control over the GPU as often as possible, but a completely "
"smooth interaction can't be guaranteed, especially on heavy scenes. This "
"is a limitation of graphics cards for which no true solution exists, "
"though we might be able to improve this somewhat in the future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:81
msgid ""
"If possible, it is best to install more than one GPU, using one for "
"display and the other(s) for rendering."

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:86
msgid "Why does a scene that renders on the CPU not render on the GPU?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:88
msgid ""
"There maybe be multiple causes, but the most common is that there is not "
"enough memory on your graphics card. We can currently only render scenes "
"that fit in graphics card memory, and this is usually smaller than that "
"of the CPU. Note that, for example, 8k, 4k, 2k and 1k image textures take"
" up respectively 256MB, 64MB, 16MB and 4MB of memory."

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:94
msgid ""
"We do intend to add a system to support scenes bigger than GPU memory, "
"but this will not be added soon."

msgid "What renders faster, NVIDIA or AMD, CUDA or OpenCL?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:113
msgid ""
"Currently NVIDIA with CUDA is rendering faster. There is no fundamental "
"reason why this should be so - we don't use any CUDA - specific features "
"- but the compiler appears to be more mature, and can better support big "
"kernels. OpenCL support is still in an early stage and has not been "
"optimized as much."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.rst:153
msgid ""
"If a GPU is used for both display and rendering, MS-Windows has a limit "
"on the time the GPU can do render computations. If you have a "
"particularly heavy scene, Cycles can take up too much GPU time. Reducing "
"Tile Size in the Performance panel may alleviate the issue, but the only "
"real solution is to use separate graphics cards for display and "
"rendering."

"Another solution can be to increase the timeout, although this will make "
