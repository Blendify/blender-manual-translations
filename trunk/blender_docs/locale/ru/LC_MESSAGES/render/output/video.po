"Sooner or later you will be struck with the desire to build an animation "

"If you render for PC then the whole rendered image which lies within the "
"*outer* dashed rectangle will be shown. For television, some lines and "
"some part of the lines will be lost due to the mechanics of the electron "
"beam scanning in your TV's cathode ray tube. You are guaranteed that what"
" is within the *inner* dashed rectangle in camera view will be visible on"
" the screen. Everything within the two rectangles may or may not be "
"visible, depending on the given TV set that your audience watches the "

"Most video tapes and video signals are not based on the RGB model but on "
"the YCrCb model: more precisely, the YUV in Europe (PAL), and the YIQ in "

"The YCrCb model sends information as 'Luminance', or intensity (Y) and "
"two 'Crominance' signals, red and blue (Cr and Cb). Actually a Black and "
"White TV set shows only luminance, while color TV sets reconstruct color "
"from Crominances (and from luminance). Construction of the YCrCb values "
"from the RGB ones takes two steps (the constants *in italics* depend on "

"Whereas a standard 24 bit RGB picture has 8 bits for each channel, to "
"keep bandwidth down, and considering that the human eye is more sensitive"
" to luminance than to chrominance, the luminance signal is sent with more"
" bits than the two chrominance signals. This bit expansion results in a "
"smaller dynamic of colors in video, than what you are used to on "

"A rule of thumb is to keep the colors as 'grayish' or 'unsaturated' as "
