"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To create "
"mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent (decreasing their "
"Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background color with the object "
"color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is away from the camera the"
" less it's alpha value will be."

"Because *Mist* works by adjusting transparency, this can sometimes cause "
"objects to be partially transparent when they shouldn't be. One workaround "
"is to set the Mist settings as desired, but turn Mist off. The Mist data is "
"still available for compositing even though it is off. Use :doc:`Do "
"Composite </composite_nodes/index>` and the :doc:`Node Editor "
"</editors/node_editor/index>` to feed the Mist pass to an :doc:`AlphaOver "
"</composite_nodes/types/color/alpha_over>` to blend the background color (or"
" a render layer with just the sky) with the rendered image. This produces "
"the mist effect but since Mist is off the object transparency (or lack of) "
"is preserved."
