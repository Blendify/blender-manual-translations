"Constraints need a frame of reference in order to function. This frame of"
" reference is called the \"space\" of the constraint. Choosing one space "
"vs. another will change this frame of reference and substantially alter "
"the behavior of a constraint."

msgid ""
"To understand how changing the space will change the behavior of the "
"constraint, consider experimenting with two empties. Make sure they "
"display as arrows so that you can see the local axes for each empty. Make"
" sure to size one empty a little larger than the other so that they are "
"both always visible even if directly on top of each other. Then add a "
"constraint to one empty that targets the other and experiment thoroughly "
"by moving, rotating and scaling the target in many different ways."

"The space used to evaluate the target of the constraint is called the "
"Target Space. The space used to evaluate the constrained object (the "
"object that owns the constraint) is called the owner space. Hover over "

"of the target or the space of the owner."

"Some constraints do not use Target or Owner space, so there will not be a"
" drop-down box. Some constraints use only Target or only Owner space, so "
"there will only be one drop-down box. Some constraints (like the Copy "
"Location constraint above) use both Target **and** Owner space, so there "
