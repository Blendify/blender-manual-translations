"Start simply. Get to know a single constraint inside and out. Copy Location "
"is a good first constraint to explore. Take the time to understand every "
"fundamental concept behind it, and the other constraints will make far more "

"Constraints control the behavior of one object with data from another. "
"Constraints can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball "
"bouncing across the court. Constraints allow the wheels on a bus to all "
"rotate together. Constraints help a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee "
"automatically. Constraints make it easy for a hand to grip the hilt of a "
"sword and the sword to swing with the hand."

#~ "Constraints can make the eyes of a tennis player track a tennis ball "
#~ "bouncing across the court. Constraints allow the wheels on a bus to all "
#~ "rotate together. Constraints help a dinosaur's legs bend at the knee "
#~ "automatically as it walks. Constraints make it easy for a hand to grip the "
#~ "hilt of a sword and the sword to swing with the hand."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ "Constraints are a way of connecting *transform properties* (position, "
#~ "rotation and scale) between objects. Constraints are in a way the object "
#~ "counterpart of the :doc:`modifiers </modeling/modifiers/index>`, which work "
#~ "on the object *data* (i.e. meshes, curves, etc.)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "All constraints share a basic :doc:`common interface "
#~ "</rigging/constraints/common_interface>`, again with many similarities with "
#~ "the modifiers' one."

#~ msgid "Use of Constraints"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Even though constraints might be very useful in static scenes (as they can "
#~ "help to automatically position/rotate/scale objects), they were first "
#~ "designed for animation, as they allow you to limit/control the freedom of an"
#~ " object, either in absolute (i.e. in global space), or relatively to other "
#~ "objects."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Also note that constraints internally work using 4x4 transformation matrices"
#~ " only. When you use settings for specific rotation or scaling constraining, "
#~ "this information is being derived from the matrix only, not from settings in"
#~ " a *Bone* or *Object*. Especially for combining rotations with non-uniform "
#~ "or negative scaling this can lead to unpredictable behavior."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Constraining bones"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Finally, there is a great rigging feature in Blender: in *Pose* mode, each "
#~ "bone of an armature behaves a bit like a standard object, and, as such, can "
#~ "be constrained. Most constraints work well with both objects and bones, but "
#~ "there are a few exceptions which are noted in the relevant constraints "
#~ "pages."
