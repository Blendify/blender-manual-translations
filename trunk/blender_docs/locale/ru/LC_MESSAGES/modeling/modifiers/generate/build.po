"emitter </scene_layout/object/properties/instancing/verts>`, and has the "
"build modifier on it. Such a setup is a workaround/technique for being "
"able to art-direct some semi-random layout of a collection of objects "
"(i.e. leaves/balls forming a carpet of sorts) when doing so with "
"particles is not desirable (e.g. due to undesirable distribution of items"
" leaving random gaps and overlapping in other places)."
