msgid ""
"*Curve Deform* provides a simple but efficient method of defining a "
"deformation on a mesh. By parenting a mesh object to a curve, you can "
"deform the mesh up or down the curve by moving the mesh along, or "
"orthogonal to, the dominant axis. This is a most useful tool to make an "
"object follow a complex path, like e.g. a sheet of paper inside a "
"printer, a film inside a camera, the water of a canal..."

msgid ""
"The *Curve Deform* works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This "
"means that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction, the mesh "
"will traverse along the curve. Moving the mesh in an orthogonal direction"
" will move the mesh object closer or further away from the curve. The "
"default settings in Blender map the Y axis to the dominant axis. When you"
" move the object beyond the curve endings the object will continue to "
"deform based on the direction vector of the curve endings."

"If the \"curve path\" is *3D*, the *Tilt* value of its control points "
"will be used (see the :doc:`Extrusion </modeling/curves/editing/extrude>`"
" section above) to twist the \"curved\" object around it. Unfortunately, "
"the other *Radius* property is not used (it would have been possible, for"
" example, to make it control the size of the \"curved\" object...)."

"Try to position your object over the curve immediately after you have "
"added it, before adding the curve deform. This gives the best control "

"The *Curve Deform* relationship is now also a modifier, called "
":doc:`Curve </modeling/modifiers/deform/curve>`. The *Curve* modifier "
"function acts the same as its counterpart, except that when the modifier "
"is used, the \"dominant axis\" is set inside its properties -- and the "
"*Track* X, Y, Z buttons no longer have an effect on it. And you have some"
" goodies, like the possibility, if \"curving\" a mesh, to only curve one "
"of its vertex groups..."
