"Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one "
"another. During this transform, movement of the selected elements will occur"
" along the horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location will be "
"defined by the *Pivot Point*. Everything that is \"above\" this axis will "
"move (Shear) in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always "
"parallel to the horizontal axis). Everything that is \"below\" the "
"horizontal axis will move in the opposite direction."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the *Shear* "
"transform function. The *Shear* option can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Object/Mesh/Curve/Surface --> Transform --> Shear` menu "
"option or by pressing :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-S`. The amount of movement given "
"to the selection can be determined interactively by moving the mouse or by "
"typing a number. Pressing :kbd:`Return` will confirm the transformation. The"
" confirmed transformation can be further edited by pressing F6 or by going "
"into the Toolshelf (:kbd:`T`) and altering the Offset slider provided that "
"no other actions take place between the *Shear* transform confirmation and "
"accessing the slider."

"Point* is set to *Median Point* (indicated by the yellow line) and the mouse"
" was moved to the left during the transform. In frame C, the *Pivot Point* "
"is set to the 3D cursor which is located above the mesh (indicated again by "
"the yellow line). When the mouse is moved to the left during a *Shear* "
