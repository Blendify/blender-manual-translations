"As mentioned before in :doc:`Vertex Groups "
"</modeling/meshes/vertex_groups/index>` each entry in a Vertex Group also "
"contains a weight value in the range of [0.0,1.0]. Blender provides a "
"*Vertex Weights* panel from where you can get (and edit) information about "
"the weight values of each Vertex of a mesh. That is: to which Vertex Groups "
"the vertex is assigned with which weight value."
