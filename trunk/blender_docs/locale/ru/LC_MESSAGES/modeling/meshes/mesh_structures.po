"A vertex is primarily a single point or position in 3D space. It is "
"usually invisible in rendering and in *Object Mode*. Do not mistake the "
"center point of an object for a vertex. It looks similar, but it's bigger"
" and you cannot select it. Fig. Vertex example shows the center point "
"labeled as \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" are vertices."

"A simple way to create a new vertex is to click :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` in *Edit "
"Mode*. Of course, as a computer screen is two-dimensional, Blender cannot"
" determine all three vertex coordinates from a single mouse click, so the"
" new vertex is placed at the depth of the 3D cursor. Using the method "
"described above, any vertices selected previously are automatically "
"connected to the new ones by an edge. In the image above, the vertex "

"*Edge* and *Face Loops* are sets of faces or edges that form continuous "
"\"loops\" as shown in Fig. Edge and Face Loops. The top row (1.0 - 4.0) "

"same loops."

msgid ""
"Note that loops (2.0 and 4.0) do not go around the whole model. Loops "
"stop at so called poles because there is no unique way to continue a loop"
" from a pole. Poles are vertices that are connected to either three, "
"five, or more edges. Accordingly, vertices connected to exactly one, two "
"or four edges are not poles."

"In the image above, loops that do not end in poles are cyclic (1. and "
"3.). They start and end at the same vertex and divide the model into two "
"partitions. Loops can be a quick and powerful tool to work with specific,"
" continuous regions of a mesh and are a prerequisite for organic "
"character animation. For a detailed description of how to work with loops"

"Loops (1. and 2.) in Fig Edge and Face Loops are edge Loops. They connect"

" not on the loop and placed on both sides of the loop (except the start "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/mesh_structures.rst:98
msgid ""
"Edge Loops are an important concept especially in organic (subsurface) "
"modeling and character animation. When used correctly, they allow you to "
"build models with relatively few vertices that look very natural when "
"used as subdivision surfaces and deform very well in animation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take Fig. Edge Loops in organic modeling as an example: the edge loops "
"follow the natural contours and deformation lines of the skin and the "
"underlying muscles and are more dense in areas that deform more when the "
"character moves, for example at the shoulders or knees."
