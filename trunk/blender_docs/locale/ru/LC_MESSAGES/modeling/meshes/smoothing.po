"As seen in the previous sections, polygons are central to Blender. Most "
"objects are represented by polygons and truly curved objects are often "

"The easiest way is to set an entire object as smooth or faceted by "
"selecting a mesh object, and in *Object* mode, click *Smooth* in the "

"you add or delete geometry."

"Notice that the outline of the object is still strongly faceted. "
"Activating the smoothing features doesn't actually modify the object's "
"geometry; it changes the way the shading is calculated across the "
"surfaces, giving the illusion of a smooth surface. Click the *Flat* "
"button in the *Tool Shelf* 's *Shading panel* to revert the shading back "

"It can be difficult to create certain combinations of smooth and solid "

"Auto smoothing can be enabled in the mesh's panel in the *Properties* "
