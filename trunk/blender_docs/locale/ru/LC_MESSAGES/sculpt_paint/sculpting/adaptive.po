"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "

"Dyntopo can be toggled with the checkbox in the header or with "

"When sculpting with multiple resolutions you have the ability to sculpt "

"used, the Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up "
"with some mesh distortions. As an advice, add as most details as possible"
" before adding more subdivisions. Clay brush, SculptDraw work better with"
" multi-resolution sculpting to sculpt secondary forms."
