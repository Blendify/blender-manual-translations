msgid ""
"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "
"method, adds and removes details on the fly. Dyntopo is quick, just get a"
" brush and start to sculpt. Dyntopo will add details base upon your brush"
" size, detail type and strength."
msgstr ""

msgid "Detail Type"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:14
msgid ""
"Dyntopo uses three different detail methods to create dynamic detail to "
"an object. The methods available are Relative Detail (Default), Constant "
"Detail, and Brush Detail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:18
msgid "Relative Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:18
msgid ""
"This method uses a detail size based on the number of pixels, and in turn"
" will create topology in that size. Zoom out big details, zoom in small "
"fines details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:21
msgid "Constant Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:21
msgid ""
"To keep detail uniform across the entire object, Constant Detail can be "
"used. The Detail is based on the percentage of a single :abbr:`BU "
"(Blender Unit)`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:26
msgid "Brush Detail"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:24
msgid ""
"Giving more control over the topology, with this method you can create "
"topology based on the brush size. You can increase and lower topology by "
"simply resizing the brush itself. The detail size is based the size of "
"the brush itself, where 100% will create topology the size of the brush "
"ring itself."

msgid "Detail Size"

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:29
msgid ""
"Each Detail Type's detail is set here. Depending on the Detail Type being"
" used this property will rather show as a pixel count (px), or "
"percentage."

msgid "Detail Refine Method"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:32
msgid ""
"When using Dynamic Topology, a certain method will be used to tell how "
"topology is handled. Setting the option will determine which of the "
"methods will be used when altering the topology."
msgstr ""

msgid "Subdivide"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:37
msgid ""
"Just like the subdivide command, this method will only subdivide topology"
" to match the detail given."
msgstr ""

msgid "Collapse"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:40
msgid ""
"When topology is too dense, and is smaller than the detail given, edges "
"will be collapse to fit the detail size appropriately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:43
msgid "Subdivide Collapse"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:43
msgid ""
"This method combines the two methods, subdividing edges smaller than the "
"detail size, and collapsing topology."

msgid "Detail Flood Fill"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:46
msgid ""
"When using Constant Detail mode, this option is made available, allowing "

msgid "Dyntopo Symmetrize"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:51
msgid ""
"Uses direction orientation to symmetrize. Since Dyntopo adds details "
"dynamical may happen that the model goes asymmetric, so this a good tool "
"for that."

msgid "Multi-Resolution Modifier"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:58
msgid ""
"The multires modifier is needed to sculpt. The modifier will subdivide "
"the mesh. The more subdivision the more computing will be needed. With "
"the Blender stack no-destructive data, multires sculpting will help when "
"you have a clean topology base mesh."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.rst:62
msgid ""
"When sculpting with multires we have the ability sculpt in different "
"level of subdivision, this mean we can sculpt some details in subdivision"
" level 1 and add more details in subdivision 2 and go back to subdivision"
" 1 correct some mistakes. While this workflow is often used, multires "
"modifier has some limitations. You may end up with some mesh distortions."
" As an advice, add as more details as possible before adding more "
"subdivisions. Clay brush, SculptDraw work better with multi-resolution "
"sculpting to sculpt secondary forms."
