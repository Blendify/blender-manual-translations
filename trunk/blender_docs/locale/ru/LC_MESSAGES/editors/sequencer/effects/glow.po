"This effect makes parts of an image glow brighter by working on the "
"luminance channel of an image. The *Glow* is the superposition of the base "
"image and a modified version, where some areas (brighter than the "
"*Threshold:*) are blurred. With the *Glow* strip properties, you control "
"this *Threshold:*, the maximum luminosity that can be added (*Clamp:*), a "
"*Boost factor:* for it, the size of the blur (*Blur distance:*), and its "
"*Quality:*. The *Only boost* button allows you to only show/use the "
"'modified' version of the image, without the base one. To \"animate\" the "
"glow effect, mix it with the base image using the Gamma Cross effect, "
"crossing from the base image to the glowing one."
