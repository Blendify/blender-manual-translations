"You can add the virtual image output of a Scene in your current .blend file "
"as well. Select the scene from the pop-up list, and a strip will be added "
"and rubberbanded to your mouse just like a movie or image. The strip length "
"will be determined based on the animation settings in that scene (not the "
"current scene, unless the VSE is operating in the same scene)."

"When adding a Scene strip, please note that, in order to show you the strip "
"in the VSE Image preview mode, Blender must render the scene. This may take "
"awhile if the scene is complex, so there may be a delay between the time you"
" select the scene and the time the strip appears. To reduce the delay, "
"simplify the scene rendering by selecting fewer layers to render."

"If the extra overhead of rendering the scene becomes burdensome (for either "
"preview or for multiple test renders) and you have enough disk space "
"consider rendering the scene to a sequence of PNGs and using an Image "
"Sequence strip instead of a scene. This is very popular for static graphic "
"overlays like title cards which are often little more than a static image "
"with animated opacity."
