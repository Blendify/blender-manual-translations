"By default, a strip Replaces the output image of any lower-level strips. "
"However, many other blending modes are available based on the strip type."
" For example, Alpha-Over automatically overlays the image on top of a "
"lower level strip. Autoblending modes remove the need for separate effect"
" strips. Blend percent controls how much of an effect the strip exerts, "
"even over time."
