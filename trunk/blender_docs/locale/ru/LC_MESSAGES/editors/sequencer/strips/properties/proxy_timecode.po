"A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main "
"image. When you Rebuild proxy Blender computes small images (like "
"thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing "
"them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling and "
"compositing functions like cross using these proxies is much faster but "
"gives a low-res result. Disable proxies before final rendering."
