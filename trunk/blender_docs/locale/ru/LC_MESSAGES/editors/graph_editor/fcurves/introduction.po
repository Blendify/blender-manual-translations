"After animating some property in Blender using keyframes you can edit "
"their corresponding curves. When something is \"animated\", it changes "
"over time. This curve is shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically "
"what an F-Curve does is an interpolation between two animated properties."

"such as the object's location, or its scale."

"As mentioned, Blender's fundamental unit of time is the \"frame\", which "

"*frame by frame*, because:"
