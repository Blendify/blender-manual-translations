"After animating some property in Blender using keyframes you can edit "
"their corresponding curves. When something is \"animated,\" it changes "
"over time. This curve in shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically "
"what an F-Curve does is it an interpolates between two animated "
"properties. In Blender, animating an object means changing one of its "
"properties, such as an objects location, or its scale."

"As mentioned, Blender's fundamental unit of time is the \"frame\", which "
