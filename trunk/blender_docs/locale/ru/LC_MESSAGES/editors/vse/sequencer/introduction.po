"The Sequencer region is horizontally divided into channels each channel "
"can contain what is called a strip. A strip can be an image, animation, "
"or any number of effects. Each channel is numbered consecutively on the Y"
" axis, starting from zero and allows up to 32 total channels. The X axis "
"represents time. Each channel can contain as many strips as it needs as "
"long as they do not overlap. If a strip needs to overlap another, it "
"needs to be placed on a channel above or below the other strip. When "
"strips are stacked, they stack from bottom to top where the lowest "
"channel forms the background and the highest the foreground."

"The first channel 0 is unusable as a place to put strips. This is because"
