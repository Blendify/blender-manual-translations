"Certain operations, like moving an object in 3D View, may not force the "

"movement may not affect the rendered image). If an image or video, used "
"as a strip, is changed by some application outside of Blender, Blender "
"has no real way of being notified from your operating system. To force "
"Blender to re-read in files, and to force a re-render of the 3D View, "
"click the *Refresh* button to force Blender to clear all cached images "
"and compute the current frame."
