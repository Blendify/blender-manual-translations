msgid ""
"To make objects move along a path is a very common animation need. Think of "
"a complex camera traveling, a train on his rails - and most other vehicles "
"can also use \"invisible\" tracks! -, the links of a bicycle chain, etc. All"
" these movements could obviously be done with standard Ipo curves, but this "
"would be a nightmare! It's much more easy and intuitive to define a path "
"materializing the desired movement, and make your object(s) follow it."

msgid ""
"Blender features you two different constraints to make an object follow a "
"path, which have different ways to determine/animate the position of their "
"owner along their path."

msgid ""
"In Blender, any :doc:`curve object </modeling/curves/introduction>` can "
"become a path. A curve becomes a path when its *Path Animation* button is "
"enabled in the *Curve* data panel, but you don't even have to bother about "
"this: once a curve is selected as target for a \"path\" constraint, it "
"automatically is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also directly add a \"path\" from the :menuselection:`Add --> Curve "
"--> Path` menu entry (in a 3D view). This will insert in your scene a "
"*three-dimensional* NURBS curve. This is an important point: by default, "
"Blender's curve are *2D* and won't move on the Z axis. To turn a standard "
"curve three-dimensional, enable its *3D* button, in the same *Curve and "
"Surface* editing panel."

"One last curve property that is important for a path is its *direction*, "
"which is, for three-dimensional ones, materialized by its small arrows. You "
"can switch it with the :menuselection:`Curve --> Segments --> Switch "
"Direction` menu entry (or :kbd:`W`, :kbd:`2`)."

"Older versions of Blender did not have constraints to make an object follow "

"based on parenting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use this method, select the object that will follow the path, then "
":kbd:`Shift` select the curve, and use :kbd:`Ctrl-P` to bring up the "
"parenting menu. Choose *Follow Path*. The object will now be animated along "
"the path."

msgid "The Follow Path Constraint"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/object_path.rst:76
msgid ""
"The *Follow Path* constraint implements the most \"classical\" technique. By"
" default, the owner object will walk the whole path only once, starting at "
"frame one, and over ``100`` frames. You can set a different starting frame "
"in the *Offset* field of the constraint panel, and change the length (in "
"frames) of the path using its *Frames* property (*Curve and Surface* panel)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/object_path.rst:82
msgid ""
"But you can have a much more precise control over your object's movement "
"along its path by keyframing or defining a *Speed* animation curve for the "
"path's *Evaluation Time* attribute. This curve maps the current frame to a "
"position along the path, from ``0.0`` (start point) to ``1.0`` (end point)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/animation/object_path.rst:94
msgid ""
"Another method of keeping objects on a path is to use the *Clamp To* "
"constraint, which implements a more advanced technique. To determine where "
"along the path should lay its owner, its uses the *location of this owner* "
"along a given axis. So to animate the movement of your owner along its "
"target path, you have to animate some way (Ipo curves or other indirect "
"animation) its location."
