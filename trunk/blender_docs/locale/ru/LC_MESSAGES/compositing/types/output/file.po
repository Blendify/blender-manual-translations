"To support subsequent arrangement and layering of images, the node can "

"Unlike the render output filepath, this node uses a base-directory and an "
"image name, by default the output path is composed of: ``{base path}/{file "

#~ "range specified, to the filename entered, as part of a frameset sequence. "
#~ "This means that the name of the file will be the name you enter plus a "
#~ "numeric frame number, plus the filename extension (based on format). Based "
#~ "on the format you choose, various quality/compression options may be shown."

#~ "The image is saved whenever Blender feels like it. Just kidding; whenever "

#~ " frame) is saved."

#~ "This node saves you from doing (or forgetting to do) the Save Image after a "

#~ "images automatically. Neat, huh?"
