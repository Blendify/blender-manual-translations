"The Distance Key node determines a pixel's alpha value based on the 3 "
"dimensional distance between the image pixel color and the key color in a"
" 3D RGB color space. This key works well when trying to single out a "
"specific color in a background (not necessarily green). It is also "
"possible to work with YCbCr color space (chroma color space) but only the"
" Cb and Cr channels are taken into consideration for determining the "
"distance between the foreground and background pixels."
