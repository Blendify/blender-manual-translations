"This node will use the Object Index pass (see RenderLayers) to produce an "
"anti-aliased alpha mask for the object index specified. The mask is opaque "
"where the object is, and transparent where the object isn't. If the object "
"is partially transparent, the alpha mask matches the object's transparency. "
"This post-process function fills in the jaggies with interpolated values."

"You can specify, for any of the objects in your scene, an Object Index as "

"rendered, if Object Index passes are enabled, its index will be 2, and "
"setting the ID Mask node to 2 will show where that object is in the scene."

"In this example, the left rear red cube is assigned PassIndex 1, and the "
"right cube PassIndex 2. Where the two cubes intersect, there is going to be "
"noticeable pixelation (jaggies) because they come together at a sharp angle "
"and are different colors. Using the mask from object 1, which is smoothed "
"(anti-aliased) at the edges, we use a Mix node set on Multiply to multiply "
"the smoothed edges against the image, thus removing those nasty (Mick) "
"Jaggies. Thus, being smoothed out, the Rolling Stones gather no moss. (I "
"really hope you get that obscure reference :)"

"Note that the mask returns white where the object is fully visible to the "
"camera (not behind anything else) and black for the part of the object that "
"is partially or totally obscured by a fully or partially opaque object in "
"front of it. If something else is in front of it, even if that thing is "
"partially transparent and you can see the object in a render, the mask will "
"not reflect that partially obscured part."
