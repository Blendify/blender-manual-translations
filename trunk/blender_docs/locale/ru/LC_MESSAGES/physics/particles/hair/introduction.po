"Hair type particle system can be used for strand-like objects, such as "
"hair, fur, grass, quills, etc."

"The first step is to create the hair, specifying the amount of hair "
"strands and their lengths."

msgid ""
"The complete path of the particles is calculated in advance. So "
"everything a particle does a hair may do also. A hair is as long as the "
"particle path would be for a particle with a lifetime of 100 frames. "
"Instead of rendering every frame of the particle animation point by point"
" there are calculated control points with an interpolation, the segments."

"The next step is to style the hair. You can change the look of base hairs"
" by changing the :doc:`Physics Settings "
"</physics/particles/emitter/physics/index>`."

msgid ""
"A more advanced way of changing the hair appearance is to use "
":doc:`Children </physics/particles/emitter/children>`. This adds child "
"hairs to the original ones, and has settings for giving them different "
"types of shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/physics/particles/hair/introduction.rst:36
msgid ""
"You can also interactively style hairs in :doc:`Particle Edit Mode "
"</physics/particles/mode>`. In this mode, the particle settings become "
"disabled, and you can comb, trim, lengthen, etc. the hair curves."

"Hair can also be used as a basis for the :doc:`Particle Instance Modifier"
" </modeling/modifiers/simulate/particle_instance>`, which allows you to "
"have a mesh be deformed along the curves, which is useful for thicker "
"strands, or things like grass, or feathers, which may have a more "
"specific look."
