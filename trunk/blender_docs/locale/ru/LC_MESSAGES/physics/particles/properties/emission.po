"The *Emitter* system works just like its name says: it emits/produces "
"particles for a certain amount of time. In such a system, particles are "
"emitted from the selected object from the *Start* frame to the *End* "
"frame and have a certain lifespan. These particles are rendered default "
"as :doc:`Halos </render/blender_render/materials/special_effects/halo>`, "
"but you may also render these kind of particles as objects (depending on "
"the particle system's render settings, see :doc:`Visualization "
