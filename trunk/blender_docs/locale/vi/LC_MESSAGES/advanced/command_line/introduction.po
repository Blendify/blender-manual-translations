#~ msgid "``malloc returns nil()``"

#~ msgid "When Blender carries out operations that require extra memory (RAM), it calls a function called malloc (short for memory allocate) which tries to allocate a requested amount of memory for Blender. If this cannot be satisfied, malloc will return nil/null/0 to indicate that it failed to carry out the request. If this happens Blender will not be able to carry out the operation requested by the user. This will most likely result in Blender operating very slowly or shutting down. If you want to avoid running out of memory you can install more memory in your system, reduce the amount of detail in your Blender models, or shut down other programs and services which may be taking up memory that Blender could use."
