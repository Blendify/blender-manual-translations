msgid "*Armature* is the constraint version of the :ref:`Armature Modifier <bpy.types.ArmatureModifier>`, exactly reproducing the weight-blended bone transformations and applying it to its owner orientation. It can be used like a variant of the :ref:`Child Of <bpy.types.ChildOfConstraint>` constraint that can handle multiple parents at once, but requires all of them to be bones."
