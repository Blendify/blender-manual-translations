msgid "Here we talk of *scale*, not of *size*! Indeed, you can have two objects, one much bigger than the other, and yet both of them have the same scale. This is also true with bones: in *Pose Mode*, they all have a unitary scale when they are in rest position, represented by their visible length."

msgid "Since scale is a multiplicative quantity, it should be combined using multiplication, and split into fractions or inverted via power. Thus the use of *Power* is more mathematically correct than *Influence*, which uses linear interpolation. The use of the *Additive* option is also not recommended."
