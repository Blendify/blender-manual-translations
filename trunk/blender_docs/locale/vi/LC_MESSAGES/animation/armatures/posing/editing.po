Unfortunately, if you have a complex rig set-up and/or a heavy skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very painful. If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform* button of the *Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated once you validate the transform operation."
