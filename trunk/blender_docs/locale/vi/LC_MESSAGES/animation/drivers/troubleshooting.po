msgid "There is a `well-known limitation <https://developer.blender.org/T40301>`__ with drivers on bones that refer to another bone in the same armature. Their values can be incorrectly calculated based on the position of the other bone as it was *before* you adjust the current frame. This can lead to obvious shape glitches when the rendering of frames has a jump in the frame number (either because the blend-file is currently on a different frame number or because you are skipping already rendered frames)."
