"There is a `well-known limitation "
"<https://developer.blender.org/T40301>`__ with drivers on bones that "
"refer to another bone in the same armature. Their values can be "
"incorrectly calculated based on the position of the other bone as it was "
"*before* you adjust the current frame. This can lead to obvious shape "
"glitches when the rendering of frames has a jump in the frame number "
"(either because the blend-file is currently on a different frame number "
"or because you are skipping already rendered frames)."
