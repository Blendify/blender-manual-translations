"Shape Keys are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In "
"other terminology, shape keys may be called *morph targets* or *blend "
"shapes*."

"The most popular uses for Shape Keys are in character facial animation "
"and in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig. They are particularly useful"
" for modelling organic soft parts and muscles where there is a need for "
"more control over the resulting shape than what can be achieved with "
"combination of rotation and scale."

"It is not possible to add or remove vertices in a shape key. The number "
"of vertices and how they connect is specified by the Mesh, Curve, Surface"
" or Lattice. A Shape Key merely records a position for each vertex and "
"therefore shapes always contain all the object's vertices."

msgid ""
"When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in "
"which it is created. Workflow-wise, adding and deleting vertices after "
"creating shape keys is possible, but it is best to leave the creation of "
"shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable."

"When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to"
" first create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or "
"surprise), and then break this complex shape into components by applying "
"a temporary vertex group to the complex shape and creating a copy with "
"*New Shape from Mix*. This technique helps reducing conflicts between "
"different shape keys that would otherwise produce a double effect."
