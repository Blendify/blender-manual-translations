"The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial "

"When adding a vertex, all shape keys will record it with the position in "

"creating shape keys is possible, but it is best to leave the creation of "
"shape keys for when the mesh is finished or its topology is stable."

"When doing facial animation with relative shape keys, it can be useful to"
" first create a shape key with a complex extreme pose (e.g. anger or "

"a temporary vertex group to the complex shape and creating a copy with "
"*New Shape from Mix*. This technique helps reducing conflicts between "
