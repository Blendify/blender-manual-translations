"*Offset*, the auto-scaling will be disabled and you can manually re-scale"

"Image sequences can use placeholder files. This works by enabling *Use "

" frame range of opened images using Blender's frame naming scheme "
"(``filename + frame number + .extension``) and makes an image sequence "
"with all files in between even if they are missing. This allows you to "
"render an image sequence with a few frames missing and still the image "
"strip will have the correct range to account for the missing frames "
"displayed as black. When the missing frames are rendered or placed in the"
" same folder, you can :ref:`refresh <bpy.ops.sequencer.refresh_all>` the "
"Sequencer and get the missing frames in the strip. The option is also "
"available when using the *Change Data/File* operator and allows you to "
"add more images to the range."
