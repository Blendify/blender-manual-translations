#~ "Boid probably comes from theoretical "

#~ "program, developed by Craig Reynolds in"
#~ " 1986, which simulates the flocking "
#~ "behavior of birds. His paper on "
#~ "this topic was published in 1987 "
#~ "in the proceedings of the ACM "
#~ "SIGGRAPH conference. The name refers to"
#~ " a \"bird-like object\", but its "
#~ "pronunciation evokes that of \"bird\" in"
#~ " a stereotypical New York accent. As"
#~ " with most artificial life simulations, "
#~ "Boids is an example of emergent "
#~ "behavior; that is, the complexity of "
#~ "Boids arises from the interaction of "
#~ "individual agents (the boids, in this"
#~ " case) adhering to a set of "
#~ "simple rules."
