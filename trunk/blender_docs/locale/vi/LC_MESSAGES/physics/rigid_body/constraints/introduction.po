"The physics constraints are meant to be attached to an :term:`Empty` "

"physics-enabled object which will be bound by the constraint. The empty "
"object provides a location and axis for the constraint distinct from the "
"two constrained objects. The location of the entity hosting the physics "
"constraint marks a location and set of axes on each of the two "
"constrained objects. These two anchor points are calculated at the "
"beginning of the animation and their position and orientation remain "
"fixed in the *local* coordinate system of the object for the duration of "
"the animation. The objects can move far from the constraint object, but "
"the constraint anchor moves with the object. If this feature seems "
"limiting, consider using multiple objects with a non-physics *Child of* "
"constraint and animate the relative location of the child."
