msgid "This object will be used as an obstacle in the simulation. As with a fluid object, obstacle objects currently should not intersect. As for fluid objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for obstacles. For objects with a volume, make sure that the normals of the obstacle are calculated correctly, and radiating properly (use the *Flip Normal* button, in *Edit Mode*, *Mesh Tools* panel, in the Tool Shelf), particularly when using a spinned container. Applying a :doc:`Subdivision Surface Modifier </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>` before baking the simulation could also be a good idea if the mesh is not animated."
