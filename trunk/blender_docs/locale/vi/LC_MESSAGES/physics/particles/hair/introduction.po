"The complete path of the particles is calculated in advance. So "
"everything a particle does a hair may do also. A hair is as long as the "
"particle path would be for a particle with a lifetime of 100 frames. "
"Instead of rendering every frame of the particle animation point by point"
" there are calculated control points with an interpolation, the segments."
