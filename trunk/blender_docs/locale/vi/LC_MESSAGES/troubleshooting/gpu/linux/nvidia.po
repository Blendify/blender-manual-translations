"On Linux, graphics drivers are usually installed as a package by your "

"For NVIDIA there are open source (Nouveau) and closed source (by NVIDIA) "

"as they are more optimized and complete. Linux graphics drivers can be "
"downloaded from NVIDIA's website, however in most cases the ones from "
"your Linux distribution are fine and make things easier. Manually "
"downloading drivers is mostly useful to get the very latest version, for "
"example for a GPU that was only recently released."
