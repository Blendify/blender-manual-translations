"A modifier based on radial curvatures of the underlying 3D surface. The "
"`curvature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature>`__ of a 2D curve at "
"a point is a measure of how quickly the curve turns at the point. The "
"quicker the turn is, the larger the curvature is at the point. The "
"curvature is zero if the curve is a straight line. Radial curvatures are "
"those computed for a 2D curve that appears at the cross section between "
"the 3D surface and a plane defined by the view point (camera location) "
"and the normal direction of the surface at the point."

"For radial curvatures to be calculated (and therefore for this modifier "
"to have any effect), the *Face Smoothness* option has to be turned on and"
" the object needs to have *Smooth Shading*."

"The limits of the mapping. If the current point of the stroke is at *Min "
"Curvature* or less from the target, it will take the start point of the "
"mapping, and conversely, if it is at *Max Curvature* or more from the "
"target, it will take the end-point value of the mapping."
