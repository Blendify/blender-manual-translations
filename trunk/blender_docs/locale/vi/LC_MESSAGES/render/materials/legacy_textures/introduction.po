msgid "These types of textures are 'real' 3D. By that we mean that they fit together perfectly at the edges and continue to look like what they are meant to look like even when they are cut; as if a block of wood had really been cut in two. Procedural textures are not filtered or anti-aliased. This is hardly ever a problem: the user can easily keep the specified frequencies within acceptable limits."

If on the other hand you use ramps and need an intensity value, you have to switch on *No RGB* in the *Mapping* panel."

#~ msgid "In CGI, texture mapping is a method to add detail to surfaces by projecting images and patterns onto those surfaces. The projected images and patterns can be set to affect not only color, but also specularity, reflection, transparency, and even fake 3-dimensional depth. Most often, the images and patterns are projected during render time, but texture mapping is also used to sculpt, paint and deform objects."

#~ msgid "This notion of using *more than one* texture, to achieve a combined effect, is one of the \"hidden secrets\" of creating realistic-looking objects. If you carefully \"look at the light\" while examining any real-world object, you will observe that the final appearance of that object is best described as the combination, in different ways and in different amounts, of several distinct underlying visual characteristics. These characteristics might be more (or less) strongly apparent at different angles, under different lighting conditions, and so forth. Blender allows you to achieve this in many ways."

#~ msgid "A Material Texture, that has a Map Input of UV, and is an image texture that is mapped to Color, is equivalent to a UV texture. It provides much more flexibility, because it can be sized and offset, and the degree to which it affects the color of your object can be controlled in the Map To panel. In addition, you can have different images for each texture channel; one for color, one for alpha, one for normals, one for specularity, one for reflectivity, *etc.* Procedural textures, like Clouds, are incredibly simple and useful for adding realism and details to an image."

#~ msgid "So, in a sense, a single UV texture for a mesh is simpler but more limited than using multiple textures (mapped to UV coordinates), because they do one specific thing very well: adding image details to a range of faces of a mesh. They work together if the procedural texture maps to the UV coordinates specified in your layout. As discussed earlier, you can map multiple UV textures to different images using the UV Coordinate mapping system in the Map Input panel."
