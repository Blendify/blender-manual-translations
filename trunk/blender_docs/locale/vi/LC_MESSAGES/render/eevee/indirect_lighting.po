"While not strictly correct, all lighting that is not coming straight out "
"from a lamp object is considered indirect lighting in Eevee. That means "
"distant HDRI lighting (or World) is considered as indirect lighting. Mesh"
" objects using an Emission node is also considered as indirect lighting."

msgid ""
"In Eevee, indirect lighting is separated into two component: Diffuse and "
"Specular. Both have different needs and representation. For efficiency, "
"the indirect lighting data is precomputed on demand into a static "
"lighting cache."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/indirect_lighting.rst:15

"As of now the light cache is static and needs to be computed before "
"rendering. It cannot be updated per frame (unless via scripting). This "
"limitation is being worked on and will be removed in future versions."

"To enable light bounces through large environment, the light baking "
"process can be run multiple times while injecting previous bake result "
