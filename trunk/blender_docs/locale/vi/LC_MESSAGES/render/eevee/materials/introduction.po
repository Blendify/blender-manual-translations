"Performance is highly dependent on the number of BSDF nodes present in "
"the node tree."

"Prefer using the Principled BSDF instead of multiple BSDF nodes because "
"Eevee is optimized for it."

msgstr "Khúc Xạ -- Refraction"

#: ../../manual/render/eevee/materials/introduction.rst:30
msgid ""
"Refraction is faked by sampling the same reflection probe used by the "
"Glossy BSDFs, but using the refracted view direction instead of the "
"reflected view direction. Only the first refraction event is modeled "
"correctly. An approximation of the second refraction event can be used "
"for relatively thin objects using Refraction Depth. Using Screen Space "
"refraction will refract what is visible in."

"As of now, Bump mapping is supported using OpenGL derivatives which are "
"the same for each block of 2x2 pixels. This means the bump output value "
"will appear pixelated. It is recommended to use Normal mapping instead."

"If you absolutely need to render using Bump nodes, render at twice the "
