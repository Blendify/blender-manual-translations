"If a *Reflection Plane* is near a reflective surface, it will be used as "
"the source for tracing rays more efficiently and fix the partial "
"visibility problem [TODO 2.8 image]. However, the reflected color will "
"not contain the following effects: Subsurface scattering, volumetrics, "
"screen space reflections, screen space refractions."

"Screen space refractions work the same way as screen space reflections "
"and use same parameters. But they are not enabled by default on all "

"enable them in :menuselection:`Material Properties --> Options`. "
