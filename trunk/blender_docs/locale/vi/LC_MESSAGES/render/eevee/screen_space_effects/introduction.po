"Eevee is not a ray tracing engine and cannot do ray-triangle "
"intersection. Instead of this, Eevee uses the depth buffer as an "
"approximated scene representation. This reduces the complexity of scene "
"scale effects and allows high performances. However, only what is in "
"inside the view can be considered when computing these effects. Also, "
"since it only use one layer of depth, only the frontmost pixel distance "
"is known."

"The screen space effects don't know how deep (or thick) the objects are. "
"This is why most effects have a thickness parameter to control how to "
"consider potential intersected pixels."
