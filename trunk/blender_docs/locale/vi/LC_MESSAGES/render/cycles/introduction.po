msgid "The transparent :abbr:`BSDF (Bidirectional scattering distribution function)` shader is given special treatment. When a ray passes through it, light passes straight on, as if there was no geometry there. The ray type does not change when passing through a transparent BSDF."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/introduction.rst:59
msgid "Alpha pass output is also different for the transparent BSDF. Other transmission BSDFs are considered opaque, because they change the light direction. As such they cannot be used for alpha-over compositing, while this is possible with the transparent BSDF."

msgid "Note that, while semantically the ray passes through as if no geometry was hit, rendering performance is affected as each transparency step requires executing the shader and tracing a ray."
