msgid "Setting the radius too high is generally not advisable. It increases denoising time a lot and, while the result might be smoother, it is not more accurate since there isn't any additional info coming out of the renderer. Beyond a radius of ~15, the additional rendering time is probably better spent on increasing the amount of samples."
