"Library Overrides is the new system designed to replace and supersede "
":doc:`Proxies</files/linked_libraries/library_proxies>`. Most types of "
"linked data-blocks can be overridden, and the properties of those "
"overrides can then be edited. When the library data change, unmodified "
"properties of the override one will be updated accordingly."

"**It is considered as experimental**, and current proxy system will be "

" that, but results on complex characters are not guaranteed."
