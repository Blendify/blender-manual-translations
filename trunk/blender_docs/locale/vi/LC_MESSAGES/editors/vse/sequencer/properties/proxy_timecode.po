msgid "A proxy is a lower resolution version (faster to load) that stands in for the main image or video. When you Rebuild proxy Blender computes small images (like thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing them, though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling and compositing functions like cross using these proxies is much faster but gives a low-res result. Disable proxies before final rendering."
