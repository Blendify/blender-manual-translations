"After animating some property in Blender using keyframes you can edit "
"their corresponding curves. When something is \"animated\", it changes "
"over time. This curve is shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically "
"what an F-Curve does is an interpolation between two animated properties."
" In Blender, animating an object means changing one of its properties, "
"such as the object's location, or its scale."

msgid ""
"As mentioned, Blender's fundamental unit of time is the \"frame\", which "
"usually lasts just a fraction of a second, depending on the *frame rate* "
"of the scene. As animation is composed of incremental changes spanning "
"multiple frames, usually these properties are **not** manually modified "
"*frame-by-frame*, because:"

#: ../../manual/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.rst:16
msgid "It would take ages!"

#: ../../manual/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.rst:17

"It would be very difficult to get smooth variations of the property "
"(unless you compute mathematical functions and type a precise value for "
"each frame, which would be crazy)."

msgid "This is why nearly all direct animation is done using *interpolation*."

#: ../../manual/editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction.rst:22
msgid ""
"The idea is simple: you define a few Keyframes, which are multiple frames"
" apart. Between these keyframes, the properties' values are computed "
"(interpolated) by Blender and filled in. Thus, the animators' workload is"
" significantly reduced."

msgid ""
"The same goes for all intermediate frames: with just two points, you get "
"a smooth increase from (0 to 10) along the 25 frames. Obviously, if you "
"would like the frame 15 to have a value of 9, you would have to add "
"another control point (or keyframe)..."
