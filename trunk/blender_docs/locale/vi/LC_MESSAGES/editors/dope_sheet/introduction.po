msgid "Classical hand-drawn animators often made a chart, showing exactly when each drawing, sound and camera move would occur, and for how long. They nicknamed this the \"dope sheet\". While CG foundations dramatically differ from classical hand-drawn animation, Blender's *Dope Sheet* inherits a similar directive."
