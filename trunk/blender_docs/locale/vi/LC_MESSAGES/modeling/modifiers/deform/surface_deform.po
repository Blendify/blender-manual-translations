"The *Surface Deform* modifier allows an arbitrary mesh surface to control"
" the deformation of another, essentially transferring its "
"motion/deformation. One great use for this is to have a proxy mesh for "
"cloth simulation, which will in turn drive the motion of your final and "
"more detailed mesh, which would otherwise not be suitable for simulation."
