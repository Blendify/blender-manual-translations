"Vertex groups are mainly used to tag the vertices belonging to parts of a"
" mesh object or :term:`lattice`. Think of the legs of a chair or the "
"hinges of a door, or hands, arms, limbs, head, feet, etc. of a character."
" In addition you can assign different weight values (in the range [ 0.0, "
"1.0 ] ) to the vertices within a vertex group. Hence vertex groups are "
"sometimes also named 'weight groups'."
