" 3D printing. Remeshing is a technique that rebuilds the geometry with a "
"more uniform topology. Remeshing can either add or remove the amount of "
"topology depending on the defined resolution. Remeshing is especially "
"useful for :doc:`sculpting </sculpt_paint/sculpting/index>`, to generate "
