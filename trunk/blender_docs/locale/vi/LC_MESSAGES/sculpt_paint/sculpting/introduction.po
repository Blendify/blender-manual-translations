"*Sculpt Mode* is similar to *Edit Mode* in that it is used to alter the "
"shape of a model, but Sculpt Mode uses a very different workflow: instead"
" of dealing with individual elements (vertices, edges, and faces), an "
"area of the model is altered using a brush. In other words, instead of "
"selecting a group of vertices, Sculpt Mode manipulates geometry in the "
"brush region of influence."
