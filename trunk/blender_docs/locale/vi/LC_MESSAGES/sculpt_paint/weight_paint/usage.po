"This is one of the main uses of weight painting. When a bone moves, "
"vertices around the joint should move as well, but just a little, to "
"mimic the stretching of the skin around the joint. Use a \"light\" weight"
" (10 - 40%) paint on the vertices around the joint so that they move a "
"little when the bone rotates. While there are ways to automatically "
"assign weights to an armature (see the :doc:`skinning section "
"</animation/armatures/skinning/index>`), you can do this manually. To do "
"this from scratch, refer to the process below. To modify automatically "
"assigned weights, jump into the middle of the process where noted:"
