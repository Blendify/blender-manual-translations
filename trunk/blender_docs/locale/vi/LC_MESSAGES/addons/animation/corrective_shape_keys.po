"I merged and converted two old scripts, to let you make corrective shape "
"keys. The first `script <http://www.apexbow.com/randd.html>`__ was "
"created by Tal Trachtman in 2007 and the second one I believe was done by"
" Brecht. That one works with any combination of modifiers, but it is very"
" slow (like three minutes for a mesh with 4,000 points). The other one "
"works only with objects that have no more than one armature."
