"Similar to the *Operator Cheat Sheet*, the script will produce a small "
"memory leak (~0.03mb) when enabled by accessing the Operator attributes "
"from Python. It is a conscious trade-off made by Blender developers, as "
"the needed setting/call in the source C code for this purpose, would "
"increase the size of every Python instance by 4 bytes. In case of complex"
" scenes, the increased memory footprint would be nontrivial compared to "
"the few usage cases where it is currently needed."
