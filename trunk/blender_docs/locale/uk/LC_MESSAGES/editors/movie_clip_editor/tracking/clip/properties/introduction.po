"Another use of Track Weights is when you want to reconstruct a scene from"
" your camera solution. In that case you can first carefully track and "
"solve your scene, and once you're done, lock all your markers with "
":kbd:`Ctrl-L`, set the tracker weight in the Extra Settings of the "
"tracker settings to zero and use the feature detection to quickly add "
"lots of markers. Now track them and solve the scene again. Since their "
"weight is zero they will not influence your solution at all, but you will"

" created \"on-demand\" (when making a stroke without adding a layer "
