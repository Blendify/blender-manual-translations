"A *Sun* lamp provides light of constant intensity emitted in a single "
"direction. A *Sun* lamp can be very handy for a uniform clear daylight "
"open-space illumination. In the 3D View, the *Sun* light is represented "
"by an encircled black dot with rays emitting from it, plus a dashed line "
"indicating the direction of the light."

"This direction can be changed by rotating the *Sun* lamp, like any other "
"object, but because the light is emitted in a constant direction, the "
"location of a *Sun* lamp does not affect the rendered result (unless you "
"use the :doc:`\"sky & atmosphere\" option "
"</render/blender_render/lighting/lamps/sun/sky_and_atmosphere>`)."
