"Procedural textures are textures that are defined mathematically. They "
"are generally relatively simple to use, because they do not need to be "
"mapped in a special way. This does not mean that procedural textures "
"cannot become very complex."

"These types of textures are 'real' 3D. By that we mean that they fit "
"together perfectly at the edges and continue to look like what they are "
"meant to look like even when they are cut; as if a block of wood had "
"really been cut in two. Procedural textures are not filtered or anti-"
"aliased. This is hardly ever a problem: the user can easily keep the "
"specified frequencies within acceptable limits."

"Each noise-based Blender texture (with the exception of Voronoi and "

"which algorithm is used to generate the texture. This list includes the "
"original Blender noise algorithm. The *Noise Basis* settings makes the "
"procedural textures extremely flexible (especially *Musgrave*)."

"Procedural textures can either produce colored textures, intensity only "
"textures, textures with alpha values and normal textures. If intensity "
"only ones are used the result is a black and white texture, which can be "
"greatly enhanced by the use of ramps. If on the other hand you use ramps "
"and need an intensity value, you have to switch on *No RGB* in the "
"*Mapping* panel."
