"The *Mapping Node* is used to transform an image or procedural texture. "
"For example, you can use it to move, rotate, or scale textures. If you "
"have ever done any UV editing in the past, then you will likely know that"
" these can also be accomplished by modifying an object's UVs in the "
":doc:`UV/Image editor </editors/uv_image/uv/index>`. However, it is "
"sometimes useful to have easy access to these functions through nodes "
"rather than having to modify the UVs. One example of this might be when "
"you have several textures, each of which needs to be transformed "
"individually e.g. decals on an object."
