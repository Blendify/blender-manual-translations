msgid ""
"The surface shader defines the light emission from the environment into "
"the scene. The world surface is rendered as if it is very distant from "
"the scene, and as such there is no two-way interacting between objects in"
" the scene and the environment, only light coming in. The only shader "
"accepted is the Background node with a color input and strength factor "
"for the intensity of the light."

msgid ""
"For image based lighting, use the Environment Texture node rather than "

"*Equirectangular* (also known as Lat/Long) for environment maps, and "
"*Mirror Ball* mapping for converting photos of mirror balls to "

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:41
msgid ""
"Currently this is most useful for night time or other dark scenes, as the"
" world surface shader or sun lamps will have no effect if a volume shader"
" is used. This is because the world background is assumed to be "
"infinitely far away, which is accurate enough for the sun for example. "
"However, for modeling effects such as fog or atmospheric scattering, it "
"is not a good assumption that the volume fills the entire space, as most "
"of the distance between the sun and the earth is empty space. For such "
"effects it is be better to create a volume object surrounding the scene. "
"The size of this object will determine how much light is scattered or "
"absorbed."

msgid "Ambient Occlusion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:55
msgid ""
"Ambient occlusion is a lighting method based on how much a point on a "
"surface is occluded by nearby surfaces. This is a trick that is not "
"physically accurate, but it is useful to emphasize shapes of surfaces, or"
" as a cheap way to get an effect that looks a bit like indirect lighting."

msgid ""
"Enabling this will sample the background texture such that lighter parts "
"are favored, creating an importance map. It will producing less noise in "

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:174
msgid ""
"Sometimes it may be useful to have a different background that is "
"directly visible versus one that is indirectly lighting the objects. A "
"simple solution to this is to add a Mix node, with the Blend Factor set "
"to Is Camera Ray. The first input color is then the indirect color, and "
"the second the directly visible color. This is useful when using a high-"
"res image for the background and a low-res image for the actual lighting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/world.rst:180

"Similarly, adding the *Is Camera* and *Is Glossy* rays will mean that the"
" high-res image will also be visible in reflections."
