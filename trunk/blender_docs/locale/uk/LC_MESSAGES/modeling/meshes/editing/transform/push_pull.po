"*Push/Pull* will move the selected elements (Objects, vertices, edges or "
"faces) closer together (Push) or further apart (Pull). Specifically, each"
" element is moved towards or away from the center by the same distance. "
"This distance is controlled by moving the mouse up (Push) or down (Pull),"
" numeric input or through slider control."

"Select the elements you want to operate on and activate the Push/Pull "
"transform function. The Push/Pull option can be invoked from the "
":menuselection:`Object/Mesh --> Transform --> Push/Pull` menu option or "
"by pressing :kbd:`Spacebar` and using the search menu to search for "
"*Push* or *Pull*. The amount of movement given to the selection can be "
"determined interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number. "
"Pressing :kbd:`Enter` will confirm the transformation. The confirmed "
"transformation can be further edited by pressing :kbd:`F6` or by going "
"into the Tool Shelf :kbd:`T` and altering the Distance slider provided "
"that no other actions take place between the *Push/Pull* transform "
"confirmation and accessing the slider."

"Note that the result of the *Push/Pull* transform is also dependant on "
"the number and type of selected elements (Objects, vertices, faces etc). "
"See below for the result of using *Push/Pull* on a number of different "
"elements."
