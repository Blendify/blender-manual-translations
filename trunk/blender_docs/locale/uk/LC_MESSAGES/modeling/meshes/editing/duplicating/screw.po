"As we have explained before, the *Screw* tool generates clean and simple "
"meshes to deal with; they are light, well-connected and are created with "
"very predictable results. This is due to the Blender calculations taking "
"into account not only the height of the vector, but also its starting "
"angle. It means that Blender will connect the vertices with each other in"
" a way that they follow a continuous cycle along the extruded generated "
"profile."
