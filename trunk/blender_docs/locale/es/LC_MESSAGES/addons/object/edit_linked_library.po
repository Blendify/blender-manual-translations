"When working in larger projects that involve scenes with assets linked "
"from a blend-file library, it can get very time-consuming to save your "
"current scene, track down the proper linked blend-file, make your "
"modifications, save, and return to your original scene file. This add-on "
"allows you to accomplish this process with only a pair of mouse clicks "
"(one to get to the linked library and one to resume work on your scene)."
