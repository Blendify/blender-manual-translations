"3D viewport draw types, UV mapping, and texture painting work somewhat "
"differently when Cycles is enabled. UV Maps no longer get image textures "
"assigned themselves; rather they must always be assigned by adding an "
"image texture node to a material."

"This draw mode is used for editing, painting and mapping individual "
"textures. Lighting is the same as in solid mode, so this is similar to "
"the existing textured solid for Blender Internal. The texture drawn is "
"the active image texture node for the material."

"A simplified version of the entire material is drawn using GLSL shaders. "
"This uses solid lighting, and also is mostly useful for editing, painting"
" and mapping textures, but while seeing how they integrate with the "
"material."

"In this draw mode the render engine does the drawing, interactively "
"refining the full rendered image by taking more samples. Unlike offline "
"rendering, objects still use the viewport rather than render resolution "
"and visibility."

"For UV mapping, the active UV map as specified in the mesh properties is "
