":abbr:`GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)` rendering makes it possible to use"
" your graphics card for rendering, instead of the CPU. This can speed up "
"rendering because modern GPUs are designed to do quite a lot of number "
"crunching. On the other hand, they also have some limitations in "
"rendering complex scenes, due to more limited memory, and issues with "
"interactivity when using the same graphics card for display and "
"rendering."

"While a graphics card is rendering, it cannot redraw the user interface, "

"There maybe be multiple causes, but the most common is that there is not "
