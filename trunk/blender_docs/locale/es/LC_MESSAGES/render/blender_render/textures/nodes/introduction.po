"As an alternative to using the :doc:`Texture Stack "
"</render/blender_render/textures/options>`, Blender includes a node-based"
" texture generation system which enables you to create textures by "
"combining colors, patterns and other textures in much the same way that "
"you combine :doc:`Material Nodes "

"To start adding nodes, you first need to select a material. Now you can "
"either click the *New* button in the Node editor, or the *New* button in "
"the texture panel. Once you have a texture selected, you can toggle it to"
" function as a regular texture or a node texture by clicking the *Use "

"The default node setup will appear: a red-and-white checkerboard node "
"connected to an *Output* named ``Default``. For *texture* nodes, you can "
"create as many Outputs as you like in your node setup. (Other types of "
"node networks, as you may recall, are limited to only one Output node.) "
