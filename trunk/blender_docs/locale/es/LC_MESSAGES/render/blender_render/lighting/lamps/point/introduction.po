"The *Point* lamp is an omni-directional point of light, that is, a point "
"radiating the same amount of light in all directions. It's visualized by "
"a plain, circled dot. Being a point light source, the direction of the "
"light hitting an object's surface is determined by the line joining the "
"lamp and the point on the surface of the object itself."

"Light intensity/energy decays based on (among other variables) distance "
"from the *Point* lamp to the object. In other words, surfaces that are "
"further away are rendered darker."
