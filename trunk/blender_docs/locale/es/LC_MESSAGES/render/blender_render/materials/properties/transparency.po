"Materials in Blender can be set to be transparent, so that light can pass"
" through any objects using the material. Transparency is controlled using"
" an \"alpha\" channel, where each pixel has an additional value, range "
"0-1, in addition to its RGB color values. If alpha=0, then the pixel is "
"transparent, and the RGB values for the surface contribute nothing to the"
" pixel's appearance; for alpha=1, the surface is fully opaque, and the "
"color of the surface determines the final color of the pixel."
