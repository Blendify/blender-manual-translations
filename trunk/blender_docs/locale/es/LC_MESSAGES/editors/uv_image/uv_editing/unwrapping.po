"The first step is to unwrap your mesh. You want to unwrap when you feel "
"your mesh is complete with respect to the number of faces it needs to "
"have. If you do add faces or subdivide existing faces when a model is "
"already unwrapped, Blender will add those new faces for you, but you may "
"need to do additional mapping or editing. In this fashion, you can use "
"the UV Texture image to guide additional geometry changes."

"Each face of a mesh can have many UV Textures. Each UV Texture can have "
"an individual image assigned to it. When you unwrap a face to a UV "
"Texture in the UV/Image Editor, each face of the mesh is automatically "
"assigned *four UV coordinates:* These coordinates define the way an image"
" or a texture is mapped onto the face. These are 2D coordinates, which is"
" why they're called UV, to distinguish them from XYZ coordinates. These "
"coordinates can be used for rendering or for real-time OpenGL display as "

"Textures. A face at the hairline of a character might participate in the "
