"There are two different collision types that you may use: collision "
"between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing"
" straight from the start: the primary targets of the collision "
"calculation are the vertices of a Soft Body. So if you have too few "
"vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges "
"and faces to improve the collision calculation."

"A cube colliding with a plane works pretty well Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-"
"collision-plane1`, but a plane falls right through a cube that it is "
"supposed to collide with Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-collision-plane2`. Why "
"is that? Because the default method of calculation only checks to see if "
"the four vertices of the plane collides with the cube as the plane is "
"pulled down by gravity. You can activate *CFace* to enable collision "
"between the face of the plane and the object instead Fig. :ref:`fig-"

"In Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-collision-vertex` you can see a vertex "

"and *Inner*, it is repulsed by a force in the direction of the face "
"normal. The position that a vertex finally ends up in is dependent on the"
" forces that act upon it. In the example gravity and the repulsion force "
"of the face balance out. The speed at which the vertex is pulled out of "

"Now lets see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them travel"

"and 6) are traveling so fast that they pass right through the collision "
"zone (this is because of the default solver precision - which we can fix "
"later). You will notice that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast "
