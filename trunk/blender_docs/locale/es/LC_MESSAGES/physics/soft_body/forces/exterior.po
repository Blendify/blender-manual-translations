"What happens? The cube moves in negative Z-direction. Each of it's eight "
"vertices is affected by a global, constant force - the gravitation. "
"Gravitation without friction is independent from the weight of an object,"
" so each object you would use as a Soft Body here would fall with the "
"same acceleration. The object does not deform, because every vertex moves"
" with the same speed in the same direction."

"This special exterior force is not applied to the vertices but to the "

"applied. The force scales with the projection of the relative speed on "
"the edge (dot product). Note that the force is the same if wind is "
"blowing or if you drag the edge through the air with the same speed. That"
" means that an edge moving in its own direction feels no force, and an "
"edge moving perpendicular to its own direction feels maximum force."
