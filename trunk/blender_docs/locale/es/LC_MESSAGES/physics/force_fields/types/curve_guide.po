"The *Curve Guide* is used to force particles to follow a certain path "
"defined by a :doc:`Curve Object </modeling/curves/index>`. A typical "
"scenario would be to move a red blood cell inside a vein, or to animate "
"the particle flow in a motor. You can use *Curve Guide* s also to shape "
"certain hair strands."

"The option *Curve Follow* does not work for particles. Instead you have "
"to set *Angular Velocity* (in the *Physics* panel of the *Particle* sub-"

"*Dynamic*)."

"*Curve Guide* s affect all particles on the same layer, independently "
"from their distance to the curve. If you have several guides in a layer, "
"their fields add up to each other (the way you may have learned it in "
"your physics course). But you can limit their influence radius by "
"changing there *Minimum Distance* (see below)."
