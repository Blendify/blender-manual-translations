"*Emitter* systems use a unified system for caching and baking (together "
"with softbody and cloth). The results of the simulation are automatically"
" cached to disk when the animation is played, so that the next time it "
"runs, it can play again quickly by reading in the results from the disk. "
"If you *Bake* the simulation the cache is protected and you will be asked"
" when you are trying to change a setting that will make a recalculating "
"necessary."

"The simulation is only calculated for the positive frames in-between the "
"*Start* and *End* frames of the *Bake* panel, whether you bake or not. So"
" if you want a simulation longer than 250 frames you have to change the "
"*End* frame!"

"As animation is played, each physics system writes each frame to disk, "
"between the simulation start and end frames. These files are stored in "
"folders with prefix ``blendcache``, next to the blend-file. Note that for"
" the cache to fill up, one has to start playback before or on the frame "
"that the simulation starts."
