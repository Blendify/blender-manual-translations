"On Windows drivers are provided by the graphics card manufacturer (Intel,"
" AMD and NVIDIA). Windows update automatically installs graphics drivers,"
" or your computer manufacturer may provide its own version of the "
"graphics drivers. However these are not always the latest version or may "
"have been corrupted in some way."

"To ensure you have the latest version, go to the graphics card "

msgid ""
"On Linux, graphics drivers are usually installed as a package by your "
"Linux distribution. Installing the latest drivers is typically done by "
"upgrading packages or the distribution as a whole. Some distributions "
"provide multiple packages for multiple drivers versions, giving you the "
"choice to install newer versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/troubleshooting/gpu.rst:41
msgid ""
"For NVIDIA there are open source (Nouveau) and closed source (by NVIDIA) "
"graphics drivers. Blender functions best with the closed source drivers "
"as they are more optimized and complete. Linux graphics drivers can be "
"downloaded from NVIDIA's website, however in most cases the ones from "
"your Linux distribution are fine and make things easier. Manually "
"downloading drivers is mostly useful to get the very latest version, for "
"example for a GPU that was only recently released."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/troubleshooting/gpu.rst:48
msgid ""
"For AMD the drivers are open source, except for the OpenCL support which "
"is available as part of Pro drivers. Installing packages through your "
"Linux distribution is usually best. AMD also provides graphics drivers "
"for download on their website if you need the latest version."
