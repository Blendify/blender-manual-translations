"Curves and :doc:`Surfaces </modeling/surfaces/introduction>` are "
"particular types of Blender Objects. They are expressed by mathematical "
"functions rather than a series of points."

"Blender offers both :doc:`/modeling/curves/bezier` and "
":doc:`/modeling/curves/nurbs`. Both Bézier curves and NURBS curves and "
"surfaces are defined in terms of a set of \"control points\" (or "
"\"control vertices\") which define a \"control polygon\"."

msgid ""
"Both Bézier and NURBs curves are named after their mathematical "
"definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of how they"
" are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's "
"perspective. Bézier curves are generally more intuitive because they "
"start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBs curves are "
"more efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists "
"and turns in a curve."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/curves/introduction.rst:24
msgid ""
"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that "
"curves are defined by less data and so can produce results using less "
"memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural "
"approach to surfaces can increase demands at render time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/curves/introduction.rst:28
msgid ""
"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a "
"path </modeling/curves/editing/extrude>`, are possible only using curves."
" On the other hand, when using curves, vertex-level control is more "
"difficult and if fine control is necessary, :doc:`mesh editing "
"</modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
msgstr ""

"Bézier curves are the most commonly used curves for designing letters or "
"logos. They are also widely used in animation, both as :doc:`paths "
"</animation/techniques/object_path>` for objects to move along and as "
":doc:`F-Curves </editors/graph_editor/fcurves/introduction>` to change "
"the properties of objects as a function of time."
