"Curve selection in *Edit Mode* has fewer options than with meshes. Mainly"
" this is, because there is only one selectable element type, the control "
"points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit more "
"complex than simple vertices, however, especially for Bézier curves, as "
"there is the central vertex, and its two handles..."

"The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes "

"One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main "
