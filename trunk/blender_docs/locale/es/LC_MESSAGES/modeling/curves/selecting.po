"Curve selection in *Edit Mode* has fewer options than with meshes. Mainly"
" this is, because there is only one selectable element type, the control "
"points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit more "
"complex than simple vertices, however, especially for Béziers, as there "
"is the central vertex, and its two handles..."

"The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes "

"One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main "
"central vertex, the two handles are automatically selected too, so you "
"can grab it as a whole, without creating an angle in the curve. However, "
"when you select a handle, only this vertex is selected, allowing you to "
"modify this control vector..."
