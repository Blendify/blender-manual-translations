"One tool of paramount importance for working with meshes is the *Extrude*"
" tool. It allows you to create parallelepipeds from rectangles and "
"cylinders from circles, as well as easily create such things as tree "
"limbs. *Extrude* is one of the most frequently used modeling tools in "
"Blender. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to use, yet very "
"powerful."

"The selection is extruded along the common normal of selected faces. In "
"every other case the extrusion can be limited to a single axis by "
"specifying an axis (e.g. :kbd:`X` to limit to the X axis or "
":kbd:`Shift-X` to the YZ plane. When extruding along the face normal, "
"limiting movement to the global Z axis requires pressing :kbd:`Z` twice, "
"once to disable the face normal Z axis limit, and once to enable the "
"global Z axis limit."

"Although the process is quite intuitive, the principles behind *Extrude* "

msgid ""
"First, the algorithm determines the outside edge-loop of the extrude; "
"that is, which among the selected edges will be changed into faces. By "
"default (see below), the algorithm considers edges belonging to two or "
"more selected faces as internal, and hence not part of the loop."

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:57
msgid ""
"If the edges in the edge-loop belong to only one face in the complete "
"mesh, then all of the selected faces are duplicated and linked to the "
"newly created faces. For example, rectangles will result in "
"parallelepipeds during this stage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:60
msgid ""
"In other cases, the selected faces are linked to the newly created faces "
"but not duplicated. This prevents undesired faces from being retained "
"\"inside\" the resulting mesh. This distinction is extremely important "
"since it ensures the construction of consistently coherent, closed "
"volumes at all times when using *Extrude*."

#: ../../manual/modeling/meshes/editing/duplicating/extrude.rst:64
msgid ""
"When extruding completely closed volumes (like e.g. a cube with all its "
"six faces), extrusion results merely in a duplication, as the volume is "
"duplicated, without any link to the original one."

"*Extrude Individual* allows you to extrude a selection of multiple faces "
"as individuals, instead of as a region. The faces are extruded along "
"their own normals, rather than their average. This has several "
"consequences: first, \"internal\" edges (i.e. edges between two selected "
"faces) are no longer deleted (the original faces are)."
