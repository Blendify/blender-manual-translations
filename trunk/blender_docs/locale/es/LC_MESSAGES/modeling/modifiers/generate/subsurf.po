"Subdivision Surface (*Subsurf* in short) is a method of subdividing the "
"faces of a mesh to give a smooth appearance, to enable modeling of "
"complex smooth surfaces with simple, low-vertex meshes. This allows high "
"resolution mesh modeling without the need to save and maintain huge "
"amounts of data and gives a smooth *organic* look to the object."
