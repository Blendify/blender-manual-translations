"The *Cast* modifier shifts the shape of a mesh, curve, surface or "
"lattice, towards any of a few predefined shapes (sphere, cylinder, "
"cuboid)."

msgid ""
"It is equivalent to the :ref:`To Sphere <tool-transform-to_sphere>` tool "
"in *Edit* mode, and what other programs call \"Spherify\" or "
"\"Spherize\", but, as written above, it is not limited to casting to a "
"sphere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/cast.rst:16
msgid ""
"The :doc:`Smooth Modifier </modeling/modifiers/deform/smooth>` is a good "
"companion to *Cast*, since the cast shape sometimes needs smoothing to "
"look nicer or even to fix shading artifacts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For performance reasons, this modifier only works with local coordinates."
" If the modified object looks wrong, you may need to apply its "

"casting to a cylinder."
