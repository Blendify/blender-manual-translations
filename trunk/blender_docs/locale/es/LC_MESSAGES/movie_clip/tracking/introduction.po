"Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and/or a camera "
"and, through the constraints, to apply this tracking data to 3D objects "
"(or just one), which have either been created in Blender or imported into"
" the application. Blender's motion tracker supports a couple of very "
"powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion reconstruction, including "
"camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some special features "
"like the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also be used to move and"
" deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor, which is available as a"
" special mode in the Movie Clip Editor."

"In Tracking Mode there are three different views available. You can "
"toggle between view modes using the View drop down, which is located in "
"the header. When you selected a view in the whole area of the Movie Clip "
"editor will change. Hence, to display a curve or dope sheet view, the "
"editor must be split into two, with one switched to the curve or dope "
"sheet view."

msgid ""
"All cameras record distorted video. Nothing can be done about this "
"because of the manner in which optical lenses work. For accurate camera "
"motion, the exact value of the focal length and the \"strength\" of "
"distortion are needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/movie_clip/tracking/introduction.rst:32
msgid ""
"Currently, focal length can be automatically obtained only from the "
"camera's settings or from the EXIF information. There are some external "
"tools which can help to find approximate values to compensate for "
"distortion. There are also fully manual tools where you can use a grid "
"which is getting affected by distortion model and deformed cells defines "
"straight lines in the footage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/movie_clip/tracking/introduction.rst:38
msgid ""
"Within Blender you can use the Annotation tool for this -- just draw a "
"line which should be straight on the footage using poly line brush and "
"adjust the distortion values to make the Grease pencil match lines on the"
" footage."

"To calibrate your camera more accurately, use the Grid calibration tool "
"from OpenCV. OpenCV is using the same distortion model, so it should not "
"be a problem."

msgid ""
"Blender not only supports the solving of camera motion, including tripod "
"shots, but also the solving of object motion in relation to the motion of"
" the camera. In addition to that there is the Plane Track, which solves "
"the motion of all markers on one plane."

"convenient compositing. There are tools to define the floor, the scene "
"origin, and the X/Y axes to perform scene orientation."
