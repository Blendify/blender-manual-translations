"This panel contains a :ref:`list view <ui-list-view>` with all objects "
"which can be used for tracking, camera or object solving. By default "
"there is only one object in this list which is used for camera solving. "
"It cannot be deleted and other objects cannot be used for camera solving;"
" all added objects are used for object tracking and solving only. These "
"objects can be referenced from Follow Track and Object Solver "
"constraints. Follow Track uses the camera object by default."

"The usage for all kind of objects (used for camera and object tracking) "
"is the same: track features, set camera data, solve motion. Camera data "
"is sharing between all objects and refining of camera intrinsics happens "
"when solving camera motion only."
