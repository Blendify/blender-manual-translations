"Annotation tool strokes can be enabled/disabled with the checkbox in the "
"panel header. It is a standard annotations panel where annotation layers "
"and frames can be controlled. There is one difference in the behavior of "
"the annotation tools from other areas -- when a new layer is created "
"\"on-demand\" (when making a stroke without adding a layer before this) "
"the default color for the layer is set to pink. This makes the stroke "
"easy to notice on all kinds of movies."
