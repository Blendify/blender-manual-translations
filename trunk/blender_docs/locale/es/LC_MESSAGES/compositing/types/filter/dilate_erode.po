"This node blurs individual color channels. The color channel (or a black "
"and white image) is connected to the *Mask* input socket, and the "
"*Distance* is set manually (by clicking on the arrows or the value) or "
"automatically from a value node or a time-and-map-value noodle. A "
"positive value of *Distance* expands the influence of a pixel on its "
"surrounding pixels, thus blurring that color outward. A negative value "
"erodes its influence, thus increases the contrast of that pixel relative "
"to its surrounding pixels, thus sharpening it relative to surrounding "
"pixels of the same color."

"In this example image, we wanted to take the rather boring array of ball "
"bearings and spruce it up; make it hot, baby. So, we dilated the red and "
"eroded the green, leaving the blue alone. If we had dilated both red and "
"green...(hint: red and green make yellow). The amount of influence is "
"increased by increasing the *Distance* values. `Blend file available "
"here. <https://wiki.blender.org/uploads/5/51/Derotest.blend>`__"
