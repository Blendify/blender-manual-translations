"As an alternative to RGB editing, color can be thought of as a mix of "
"Hues, namely a normalized value along the visible spectrum from infra-red"
" to ultraviolet (the rainbow, remember \"Roy G. Biv\"). The amount of the"
" color added depends on the saturation of that color; the higher the "
"saturation, the more of that pigment is added. Use the saturation slider "
"of this node to \"bring out\" the colors of a washed-out image."

"This node takes an input image and runs the color of the image (and the "

"The **Hue** slider specifies how much to shift the hue of the image. Hue "
"0.5 (in the middle) does not shift the hue or affect the color of the "
"image. As Hue shifts left, the colors shift as more cyan is added; a blue"
" image goes bluer, then greener, then yellow. A red image goes violet, "
"then purple, blue, and finally teal. Shifting right (increasing Hue from "
"0.5 to 1.0) introduces reds and greens. A blue image goes purple, plum, "
"red, orange, and then yellow. A red image goes golden, olive, green, and "
"cyan."
