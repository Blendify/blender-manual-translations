"Vertex Groups can potentially have a very large number of associated "
"vertices and thus a large number of weights (one weight per assigned "
"vertex). *Weight Painting* is a method to maintain large amounts of "
"weight information in a very intuitive way. It is primarily used for "
"rigging meshes, where the vertex groups are used to define the relative "
"bone influences on the mesh. But we use it also for controlling particle "
"emission, hair density, many modifiers, shape keys, etc."
