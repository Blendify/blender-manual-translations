"Dynamic topology (aka dyntopo) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting "
"method, adds and removes details on the fly. Dyntopo is quick, just get a"

"Giving more control over the topology, with this method you can create "
"topology based on the brush size. You can increase and lower topology by "
"simply resizing the brush itself. The detail size is based the size of "
"the brush itself, where 100% will create topology the size of the brush "
"ring itself."

"When sculpting with multiresolution we have the ability sculpt in "

"Multiresolution Modifier has some limitations. You may end up with some "
"mesh distortions. As an advice, add as more details as possible before "
