"*Noise* is an old feature. The :doc:`Displace Modifier "
"</modeling/modifiers/deform/displace>` is a non-destructive alternative "
"to the Noise tool and is a more flexible way to realize these sort of "
"effects. The key advantages of the modifier are that it can be canceled "
"at any moment, you can precisely control how much and in which direction "
"the displacement is applied, and much more..."

"The *Noise* function allows you to displace vertices in a mesh based on "
"the gray values of the first texture slot of the material applied to the "
"mesh."

"The mesh must have a material and a texture assigned to it for this tool "
"to work. To avoid having the texture affect the material's properties, it"
" can be disabled in the texture menu."

"*Noise* permanently modifies your mesh according to the material texture."
" Each click adds onto the current mesh. For a temporary effect, map the "
"texture to Displacement for a render-time effect. In *Object Mode* or "
"*Edit Mode*, your object will appear normal, but will render deformed."
