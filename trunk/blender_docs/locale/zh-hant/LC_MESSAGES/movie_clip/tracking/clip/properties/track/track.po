"The widget in this panel is called \"Track Preview\" and it displays the "
"content of the pattern area. This helps to check how accurately the "
"feature is being tracked (controlling that there is no sliding off "
"original position) and also helps to move the track back to the correct "
"position. The track can be moved directly using this widget by mouse "
"dragging."

"If an anchor is used (the position in the image which is tracking is "
"different from the position which is used for parenting), a preview "
"widget will display the area around the anchor position. This "
"configuration helps in masking some things when there is no good feature "
"at position where the mask corner should be placed. Details of this "
"technique will be written later."

msgid ""
"When several tracks are used for 3D camera reconstruction, it is possible"

"the solution result. This parameter can (and often need to) be animated."

"Altering the weights of problem tracking markers can correct or greatly "

msgid ""
"Another use of Track Weights is when you want to reconstruct a scene from"
" your camera solution. In that case you can first carefully track and "
"solve your scene, and once you're done, lock all your markers with "
":kbd:`Ctrl-L`, set the tracker weight in the Extra Settings of the "
"tracker settings to zero and use the feature detection to quickly add "
"lots of markers. Now track them and solve the scene again. Since their "
"weight is zero they will not influence your solution at all, but you will"
" have lots of good reference points in your scene."

"This setting overrides the default marker color used in the Clip editor "
"and 3D View, and it helps to distinguish different type of features (for "
"example, features in the background vs. foreground and so on). Color also"
" can be used for \"grouping\" tracks so a whole group of tracks can be "
"selected by color using the Select Grouped operator."
msgstr ""

"To select good points for tracking, use points in the middle of the "
"footage timeline and track backwards and forwards from there. This will "
"provide a greater chance of the marker and point staying in the camera "
"shot."
