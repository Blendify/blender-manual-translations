"The NLA editor, short for Non-Linear Animation, can manipulate and "
"repurpose :doc:`/animation/actions`, without the tedium of handling "
"keyframes. It is often used to make broad, significant changes to a "
"scene's animation, with relative ease. It can also re-purpose, chain "
"together a sequence of motions, and \"layer\" actions, which make it "
"easier to organize, and version-control your animation."
