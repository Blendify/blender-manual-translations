"The *Title* shows the name/type of the node. It can be overridden by "
"changing the value of Label in the *Node* section of the *Properties "
"Region* :kbd:`N`. On the left side of the title is the *collapse toggle* "
"which can be used to collapse the node this can also be done with "
":kbd:`H`."

"The *Sockets* input and output values from the node. They appear as "

"Indicates numeric values information. It can either be a single numerical"

"grayscale-map where the different amount of bright/dark reflects the "
"value for each point). If a single value is used as an input for a "
"\"value map\" socket, all points of the map are set to this same value. "
