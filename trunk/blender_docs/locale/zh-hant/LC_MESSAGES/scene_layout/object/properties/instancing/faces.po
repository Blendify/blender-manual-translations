"The positioning of the instanced geometry relative to the face is "
"dependent upon the position of the child objects relative to the "
"instancer's origin. This can lead to some visual artifacts in the 3D "
"Viewport as the geometry of the original objects overlaps or intersects "
"with the instanced geometry. One workaround is to move the origin of the "
"instancer mesh off of the plane of the faces."

"If the geometry of the children is not symmetrical then the orientation "
"of the face (as determined by the order of its vertices) could matter. As"
" of 2.70 Blender does not have tools which allow you to adjust the "
"ordering of the vertices on a face."

"However, there is a workflow that lets you control for this. Make a "
"single square and enable the *Instancing Faces* so you can see the "
"instanced geometry in the 3D Viewport. If the orientation is not what you"
" want, rotate the face until it is how you want. Typically you want to do"
" the rotation in Edit Mode, not Object Mode, but this is not a hard rule."

"Once you have the orientation correct, Duplicate the face and move the "

"faces. Since it is common for these faces to butt up against one another,"
" your geometry will have lots of duplicate vertices. Use the *Merge by "
"Distance* button in the Tools panel."
