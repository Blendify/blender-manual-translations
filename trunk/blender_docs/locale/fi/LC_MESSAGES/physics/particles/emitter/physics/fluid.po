"Blender particle fluids use the SPH techniques to solve the particles "
"fluid equations. Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational"
" method used for simulating fluid flows. It has been used in many fields "
"of research, including astrophysics, ballistics, vulcanology, and "
"oceanography. It is a mesh-free Lagrangian method (where the co-ordinates"
" move with the fluid), and the resolution of the method can easily be "
"adjusted with respect to variables such as the density."
