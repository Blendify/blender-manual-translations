"Rigify helps automate the creation of character rigs. It is based around "
"a building-block approach, where you build complete rigs out of smaller "
"rig parts (e.g. arms, legs, spines, fingers...). The rig parts are "
"currently few in number, but as more rig parts are added to Rigify it "
"should become more and more capable of rigging a large variety of "
"characters and creatures."

"Rigify also operates on the principle that once a rig is created, that "
"rig should no longer need Rigify. This means you can always distribute "
"rigs created with Rigify to people who do not have it and the rigs will "
"still function completely."

"It is important to note that Rigify only automates the creation of the "
"rig controls and bones. It does not attach the rig to a mesh, so you "
"still have to do skinning etc. yourself."

"Rigify build blocks can be mixed together to rig any character you want. "
"If you need to build a character with five arms and one leg Rigify can "
"handle it for you creating all the required complex controls system (FK, "
"IK, and all the relative snapping tools and the UI) in few seconds."

"If the generated rig doesn't fit all the features you need or, for "
"example, you decide to add something more to your character (like a sixth"
" arm or a tail), you can re-generate your rig without losing your "
"previously generated features and your animation data."

"The included rig samples (limbs, spines, tails, fingers, faces...) adds "
