"To use Cycles, it must be set as the active render engine in the top "
"header. Once that is done, interactive rendering can be started by "
"setting a 3D View editor to draw mode Rendered using :kbd:`Shift-Z`. The "
"render will keep updating as modifications are done, such as changing a "
"material color, changing a lamp's intensity or moving objects around. To "
"perform a full render go to :menuselection:`Properties --> Render` here "
"you can either choose to render a still image or an :doc:`Animation "
