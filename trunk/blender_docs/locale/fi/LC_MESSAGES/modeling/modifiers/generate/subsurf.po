"The Subdivision Surface Modifier is used to split the faces of a mesh "
"into smaller faces giving a smooth appearance. Using this modifier, "
"enables you to model complex smooth surfaces with simple, low-vertex "
"meshes. This allows high resolution mesh modeling without the need to "
"save and maintain huge amounts of data and gives a smooth *organic* look "
"to the object."
