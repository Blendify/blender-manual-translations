"image. This section covers how to export an outline of your UV map, and "

"View into Textured viewport shading, you will immediately see any changes"
" made in the UV Editor, and vice versa. This is because no real rendering"
" is taking place; it is all just viewport shading. If you were to apply "
"an image to UVs then render, the texture would not show up by default."
