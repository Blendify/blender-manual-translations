"The most flexible way of mapping a 2D texture over a 3D object is a process called \"UV mapping\". In this process, you take your three-dimensional (X, Y & Z) mesh and unwrap "
"it to a flat two-dimensional (X & Y ... or rather, as we shall soon see, \"U & V\") image. Colors in the image are thus mapped to your mesh, and show up as the color of the "
"faces of the mesh. Use UV texturing to provide realism to your objects that procedural materials and textures cannot do, and better details than Vertex Painting can provide."

"If you were to take a pair of scissors and cut a seam or fold of the box, you would be able to lay it flat on a tabletop. As you are looking down at the box on the table, we "
"could say that U is the left-right direction, is V is the up-down direction. This image is thus in two dimensions (2D). We use U and V to refer to these \"texture-space "
"coordinates\" instead of the normal X and Y, which are always used (along with Z) to refer to the three dimensional space (3D)."

"拿一把剪子沿折线裁开盒子，就可以把它平铺到桌面。俯视桌子上的盒子，把左右方向称之为U，上下方向称之为V。图像就这样变成了二维(2D)。我们用U和V来代替常规的X和Y指代“纹理空间坐标”，"

"During the UV unwrapping process, you tell Blender exactly how to map the faces of your object (in this case, a box) to a flat image in the UV/Image Editor. You have complete "

"On more complex models (like seen in the earth map above) there pops up an issue where the faces cannot be cut, but instead they are stretched in order to make them flat. "
