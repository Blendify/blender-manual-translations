"Motion Tracking is used to track the motion of objects and applying that "
"data to 3D object through the compositor. Blender's motion tracker "
"supports a couple of very powerful tools for 2D tracking and 3D motion "
"tracking, including camera tracking and object tracking, as well as some "
"special features like the plane track for compositing. Tracks can also "
"be used to move and deform masks for rotoscoping in the Mask Editor, "
"which is available as a special mode in the Movie Clip Editor."
