"When talking about the movement stabilization of video, we have to "

"Since the actual image elements, i.e. the subject of our footage can be "

"Introducing this concept of a \"canvas\" helps to deal with deliberate "

"is very frequent for the pixels of video footage to be *non square.* So we "

"But when the camera was *moved intentionally*, we have to consider yet "
"another frame of reference beyond the canvas: namely the frame (or *\"cadre"

"distinction, let's consider a hand-held, panning shot to the right: Since our "
"camera was turned towards the right side, the actual image contents move "
"towards the left side *within* the original image frame. But let's assume the "
"stabilizer was successful with \"fixing\" any image contents relative to the "
"*canvas* -- which in turn means, that the original image boundaries start to "
"move irregularly towards the right side, and the *contents* of the image will "
"begin to disappear gradually behind the left boundary of the original image. "
"After some amount of panning, we'll have lost all of our original contents "

"As explained above, when we succeed with stabilizing the image contents, the "
