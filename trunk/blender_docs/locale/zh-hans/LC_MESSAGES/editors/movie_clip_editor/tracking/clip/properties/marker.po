"Makes sense after solving the movie clip, and it works in the following "
"way: the solved position of each track gets projected back to the movie "
"clip and displayed as a small point. The color of the point depends on "
"the distance between the projected coordinate and the original "
"coordinate: if they are close enough, the point is green, otherwise it "
"will be red. This helps to find tracks which were not solved nicely and "
"need to be tweaked."

"解决了影片剪辑后是有道理的，它在以下方式运行：每首曲目的解决位置被投射回"
"影片剪辑，作为一个小点显示。该点的颜色取决于投影坐标和原来的坐标之间的距"
"离：如果它们是足够接近，该点是绿色的，否则这将是红色的。这有助于找到那些"
"没有很好地解决，需要进行调整轨道。"

"The way in which markers are displayed compact (black outline and yellow "
"foreground color) makes tracks visible on all kind of footage (both dark "
"and light). But sometimes it can be annoying and this option will make "
"the marker display more compactly -- the outline is replaced by dashed "
"black lines drawn on top of the foreground, so that marker areas are "
"only 1px thick."

"此项是标记点的显示方式（黑色外框搭配黄色前景色），使得轨迹能够在各类镜头"
"中得到清晰的显示（无论明暗）。然而有时这种显示方式会不适用，而此选项可以"
"让标记点以更小巧的形式显示——外框会被黑色虚线所替代，位于前景色上层。这样"
"一来，标记点区块的外框厚度仅有1像素。"
