"Each track contributes to the overall result by the degree controlled through its *Stab Weight* parameter. It is evaluated on a per-frame basis, which enables us to "
"control the influence of a track by *animating* this *Stab Weight*. You may imagine the overall working of the stabilizer as if each tracking point \"drags\" the image "
"through a flexible spring: When you turn down the *Stab Weight* of a tracking point, you decrease the amount of \"drag\" it creates. Sometimes the contribution of "
"different tracks has to work partially counter each other. This effect might be used to cancel out spurious movement, e.g. as caused by perspective. But when, in such a "
"situation, one of the involved tracks suddenly goes away, a jump in image position or rotation might be the result. Thus, whenever we notice a jump at the very frame "
"where some partially covered track starts or ends, we need to soften the transition. We do so by animating the *Stab Weight* gradually down, so that it reaches zero at "
"the boundary point. In a similar vein, when we plan a \"handover\" between several partially covered tracks, we define a *cross-fade* over the duration where the tracks "
"overlap, again by animating the *Stab Weight* parameters accordingly. But even with such cross-fade smoothing, some residual movement might remain, which then needs to be "
