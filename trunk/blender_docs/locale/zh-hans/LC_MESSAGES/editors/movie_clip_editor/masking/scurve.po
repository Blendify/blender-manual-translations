"The curve type used for creating mask splines is almost a Bézier curve, "
"but with some differences. Smooth edges of the mask are defined by "
"feathering. The curve needed to support feathering in a way that stuck "
"to the curve as you edited it, for ease of editing an animation. These "
"are called S-Curves."

"由羽化来定义。为了便于编辑动画，在编辑曲线时，需要以支持曲线的方式支持羽"
"化。这些被称为S曲线。"

"Besides the handles, every control point also has points that define the "
"feather between the current point and the next point on the spline. Each "
"feather point is stored in UV space, where U means position across "
"spline segment, and V means distance between main spline and feather "
"points."

"除了手柄之外，每个控制点还有一些点，用于定义当前点和样条曲线上下一个点之"
"间的距离。每个羽化点存储在UV空间中，其中U表示跨样条线段的位置，而V表示主"

"feather will be updated automatically to reflect that change."

"For example if there is just rotation of the spline, feather would stay "
"completely unchanged. If one point's feather is moved, the other "
"feathers will be automatically stretched uniformly along that segment "
"and the overall shape will be almost the same as artists would want it "
"to be."

"例如，如果只是旋转样条线，羽化将保持完全不变。如果一个点的羽化被移动，其"
"他羽化将自动沿着该线段均匀拉伸，并且整体形状将与艺术家希望的那样几乎相"
