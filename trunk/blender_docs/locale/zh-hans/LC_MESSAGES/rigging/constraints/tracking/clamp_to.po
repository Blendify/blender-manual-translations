"The *Clamp To* constraint clamps an object to a curve. The *Clamp To* constraint is very "
"similar to the :doc:`Follow Path </rigging/constraints/relationship/follow_path>` "
"constraint, but instead of using the evaluation time of the target curve, *Clamp To* will "
"get the actual location properties of its owner (those shown in the *Transform* panel), "
"and judge where to put it by \"mapping\" this location along the target curve."

"One benefit is that when you are working with *Clamp To*, it is easier to see what your "
"owner will be doing; since you are working in the 3D View, it will just be a lot more "

"A downside is that unlike in the :doc:`Follow Path constraint </rigging/constraints/"
"relationship/follow_path>`, *Clamp To* does not have any option to track your owner's "
"rotation (pitch, roll, yaw) to the banking of the targeted curve, but you do not always "
"need rotation on, so in cases like this it's usually a lot handier to fire up a *Clamp "
"To*, and get the bits of rotation you do need some other way."

"缺点是，不像跟随路径（ :doc:`Follow Path </rigging/constraints/relationship/"
