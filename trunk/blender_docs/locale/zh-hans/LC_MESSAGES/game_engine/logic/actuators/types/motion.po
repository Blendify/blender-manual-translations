"*Simple Motion* gives control over position and velocity, but does this "
"as an instant displacement; the object never passes any of the "
"coordinates between the start and end positions. This can interfere with "
"the physical simulation of other objects, and can cause an object to go "
"through another object. The `Servo Control`_ actuator does not suffer "
"from this, since it produces physically correct velocities, and leaves "
"updating the position to the physics simulation."

"The Servo Control actuator influences the velocity of a game object by "

"objects controlled by the physics simulation. The amount of force "
"necessary is determined by a `PID controller "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller>`__, a type of controller "
"that is often used in control systems. Only the positional velocity is "
"influenced by this actuator; it does not control rotation at all, and it "
"controls position only indirectly."

"Controlling the position is not necessary in that respect; that is left "
