"Pathfinding in Blender is based on the concept of `navigation meshes "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh>`__. With this you can "
"create navigation mesh for your level geometry directly in Blender and "
"use it in Blender Game Engine (BGE) to get your actors to find path to "
"the target and move along it. It is useful for creating an artificial "
"intelligence. Besides path following, there are also a few other steering"
" behaviors which can be assigned to the actor: *seek* and *flee*."

"Pathfinding with a navigation mesh is most effective for big static "
"obstacles. To enable actors to avoid small dynamic objects during their "
"movement local obstacle avoidance can be used. If the obstacle simulation"
" is enabled the actor will try to choose direction which is free of "
"collision with obstacles on each frame during execution one of the "
"steering behaviors."
