"In CGI, texture mapping is a method to add detail to surfaces by "
"projecting images and patterns onto those surfaces. The projected images "
"and patterns can be set to affect not only color, but also specularity, "
"reflection, transparency, and even fake three-dimensional depth. Most "
"often, the images and patterns are projected during render time, but "
"texture mapping is also used to sculpt, paint and deform objects."
msgstr "在计算机合成图像中，纹理映射是一种将纹理和花纹添加到物体表面上的途径。添加这些纹理和花纹可以提升模型的精细度。这些纹理和花纹不仅可携带颜色信息，也可携带高光，反射，透明信息。甚至还能做出虚假的三维深度。一般情况下，只有在渲染步骤中，这些纹理和贴图才发挥作用。但纹理映射也可用于雕刻（作为笔刷），扭曲物体以及绘画。"

"The material settings that we've seen so far produce smooth, *uniform* "
"objects, but such objects are not particularly true to reality, where "
"uniformity tends to be uncommon and out of place. In order to deal with "
"this unrealistic uniformity, Blender allows the user to apply *textures* "
"which can modify the reflectivity, specularity, roughness and other "
"surface qualities of a material."
msgstr "稍有常识就能看出，如我们只赋予物体材质，物体会呈现出极端光滑和统一的状态，假如五毛特效，一点不真实。特别光滑统一的材质会使物体看上去很神经，且与周围环境格格不入。为了让物体看上去正常，Blender允许使用者给物体添加贴图，借此改变物体的高光，反射，粗糙程度等等表面材质数值。"

"This notion of using *more than one* texture, to achieve a combined "
"effect, is one of the \"hidden secrets\" of creating realistic-looking "
"objects. If you carefully \"look at the light\" while examining any real-"
"world object, you will observe that the final appearance of that object "
"is best described as the combination, in different ways and in different "
"amounts, of several distinct underlying visual characteristics. These "
"characteristics might be more (or less) strongly apparent at different "
"angles, under different lighting conditions, and so forth. Blender allows"
" you to achieve this in many ways."
msgstr "制作出超真实材质的“葵花宝典”（诀窍诀窍），就是使用多个纹理混合做出混合效果。当你认真审视真实物体的时候观察光感，你就会发现物体的材质是一个混合状态。物体包含了不同程度的显性和隐性特征，而观察的角度光照不同，观察到的特征也就不同。我们碉堡的Blender可以用很多方式来实现这种构造。你可用本章节提到的办法，往材质上糊一堆纹理，或者用一堆繁杂的纹理节点做到同样的效果。选择是多样的，只要你开心。"

"A Material Texture, that has a Map Input of UV, and is an image texture "
"that is mapped to Color, is equivalent to a UV texture. It provides much "
"more flexibility, because it can be sized and offset, and the degree to "
"which it affects the color of your object can be controlled in the Map To"
" panel. In addition, you can have different images for each texture "
"channel; one for color, one for alpha, one for normals, one for "
"specularity, one for reflectivity, *etc.* Procedural textures, like "
"Clouds, are incredibly simple and useful for adding realism and details "
