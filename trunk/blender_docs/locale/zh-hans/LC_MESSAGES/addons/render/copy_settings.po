"This is a simple tool that adds in the Render properties a new panel "

"I wrote it as I often have tenth of scenes all edited/gathered in a "
"single \"main\" scene sequence. When I want to make preview renders of "
"that main scene, I had to manually set all other scenes' preview scale "
"-- long and boring. And even worse, I often forgot to put them back to "
"full resolution before final rendering!"

"This lists all render settings. The checkbox to the right controls "

"corresponding item in this list."
