"There are two main ways to use the Bridge tool, both of which are "

"This option has no label, but is located directly to the right of the "
"segments setting. The simple explanation: 0% lot of triangles, 100% mostly "
"square faces. There is a bit more to it though. It determines when a new "
"vertex has to be created, or when to use the vertex next to it. It does this "
"based on the distance between these vertices compared to the distance "
"between the vertices in the original loops. So 50% means that if the "
"distance between two vertices that will be newly created is smaller than "
"half the distance between two vertices in the original loop, they will be "
"merged together, resulting in only a single new vertex. This is also "
"demonstrated in the video above."

"limits of this option are set to range from -3 to +3, but you can easily "
