"The chan format is used to store camera animations, including location, "

"The file format itself is as simple as can be, but its simplicity is its "
"greatest advantage. It is being used by applications like Nuke and "
"Houdini, and since it is so simple to write an import or export script "
"for it is both fast and easy."

"The add-on gets the currently active object (works in Object Mode only) "
"and saves/loads its transformations from or to a simple ASCII file, "
"through the whole animation range (set either in the Timeline or in the "
"render settings). All you need to do is to select an object and run the "
"add-on in :menuselection:`File --> Import/Export --> Nuke(*.chan)`."

"Note that Chan saves only the raw property values (``rotation_x``, "
"``rotation_y``, ``rotation_z``, etc.), so you have to mind the rotation "
"order. In other words -- the rotation orders during export and import "
"must be the same (both are being set in the File Browser while "
"importing/exporting)."

"Another thing is the camera sensor size and its influence on camera lens."
" You can set the sensor size so you can fit a real life cameras (default "
"in Blender is 32 × 18), the best practice in this case is using "
"horizontal fit for the camera (Nuke is using this as a default). While "
"importing the camera from a chan file you have to remember to set the "
"same sensor size as you had in Nuke (or other software that this camera "
"has been exported)."
