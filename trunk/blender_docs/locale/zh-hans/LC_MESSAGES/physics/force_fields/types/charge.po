"A *Charge* force field is similar to spherical field except it changes "
"behavior (attract/repulse) based on the effected particles charge field "
"(negative/positive), like real particles with a charge. This mean this "
"field has only effect on particles that have also a *Charge* field "
"(else, they have no \"charge\", and hence are unaffected)!"

"一个 *电荷* 力场类似于球形场除了它改变行为（吸引/击退）的基础上实现的粒子"
"电荷场（负/正），就像用电荷实粒子。这意味着这个字段只对具有电荷力场的粒子"
"产生影响（否则，它们没有 *电荷* ，因此不受影响）！"
