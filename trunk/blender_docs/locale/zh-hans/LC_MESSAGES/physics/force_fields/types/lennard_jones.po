"The *Lennard Jones* force field is a very short range force with a "
"behavior determined by the sizes of the effector and effected particle. "
"At a distance smaller than the combined sizes, the field is very "
"repulsive and after that distance it is attractive. It tries to keep the "
"particles at an equilibrium distance from each other. Particles need to "
"be at a close proximity to each other to be effected by this field at "
"all."

"小而确定的行为。在距离小于组合尺寸的距离处，该场是非常排斥的，此后距离是"
"有吸引力的。它试图保持颗粒彼此平衡的距离。粒子需要靠近彼此才能被这个领域"
"所影响。"
