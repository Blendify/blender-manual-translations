"To create a connection between the vertices of a soft body object there "

"effective along the edges in a mesh, the connections between the "
"vertices. The forces act like a spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-"

"But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional "

"edges between the vertices. This works pretty well, but would change your"
