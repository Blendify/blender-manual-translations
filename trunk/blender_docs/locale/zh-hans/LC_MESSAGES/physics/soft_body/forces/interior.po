"To create a connection between the vertices of a Soft Body object there have to "
"be forces that hold the vertices together. These forces are effective along the "
"edges in a mesh, the connections between the vertices. The forces act like a "
"spring. Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-force-interior-connection` illustrates how a "
"3×3 grid of vertices (a mesh plane in Blender) are connected in a Soft Body "
"simulation."

"But two vertices could freely rotate if you do not create additional edges "
"between them. Have you ever tried building a storage shelf out of four planks "
"alone? Well, do not do it, it will not be stable. The logical method to keep a "
"body from collapsing would be to create additional edges between the vertices. "
"This works pretty well, but would change your mesh topology drastically."

"Luckily, Blender allows to define additional *virtual* connections. On one hand "

"hand we can define virtual connections between a vertex and any vertices "
"connected to its neighbors *Bending Stiffness*. In other words, the amount of "
"bend that is allowed between a vertex and any other vertex that is separated by "
"two edge connections."
