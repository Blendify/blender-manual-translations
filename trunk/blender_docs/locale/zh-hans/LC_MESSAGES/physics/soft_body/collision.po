"There are two different collision types that you may use: collision "
"between different objects and internal collision. We should set one thing "
"straight from the start -- the primary targets of the collision "
"calculation are the vertices of a soft body. So if you have too few "
"vertices too few collision takes place. Secondarily, you can use edges and "
"faces to improve the collision calculation."

"A soft body cube colliding with a plane (Fig. :ref:`fig-softbody-collision-"

"In the video below, you can see the vertices colliding with a plane. If a "
"vertex penetrates the zone between *Outer* and *Inner*, it is repulsed by "
"a force in the direction of the face normal. The position that a vertex "
"finally ends up in is dependent on the forces that act upon it. In the "
"example (the first vertex on the left in the video below) gravity and the "
"repulsion force of the face balance out. The speed at which the vertex is "
"pulled out of the collision zone is influenced by the *Choke* parameter in "
"the :ref:`Soft Body Solver settings <physics-softbody-settings-solver>`."

"在下面的视频中，演示了顶点与平面碰撞的模型。如果一个顶点穿透了 *外部* 与 *"

"Now let's see what happens if we make vertices heavier and let them travel "

"different speeds. The two on the far right (fifth and sixth) are traveling "
"so fast that they pass right through the collision zone (this is because "
"of the default solver precision, which we can fix later). You will notice "
"that the fourth vertex also travels quite fast and because it is heavier "
"it breaches the inner zone. The first three vertices collide correctly."
