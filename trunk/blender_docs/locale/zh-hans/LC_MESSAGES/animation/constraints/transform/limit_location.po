"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the X, Y and Z "

"through lower and upper bounds."

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual and "
"rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still allows (by default) the "
"object or bone to have coordinates outside the minimum and maximum ranges. This can be "
"seen in its *Transform* panel."

"值得注意的是，尽管约束限制了其视觉和渲染位置，约束对象的数据块仍然允许(默认)对象或骨骼"

"When an owner is selected and attempted to be moved outside the limit boundaries, it "
"will be constrained to those boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, "
"its coordinates will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, "
"its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally specified location."
msgstr ""
"当拖动物体，并试图超出限定边界，视觉上以及渲染时，物体仍然被限定在边界内，但在内部，其"

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the limits, dragging "
"it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the internal coordinates "
"are back within the limit threshold (unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, "
"see below)."

"类似地，如果约束对象的内部坐标超出范围，把它拖回到限制区域，在其内部坐标回到限定范围内"

"this button, this is no longer possible -- the owner's transform properties are also "

"尽管默认情况下视觉看到的约束对象没有超出上下限，但约束对象的实际坐标仍然可以超出范围"
