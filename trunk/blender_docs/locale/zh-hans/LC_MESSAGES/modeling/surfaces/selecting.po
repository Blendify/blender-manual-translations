"Surface selection in *Edit Mode* is very similar to :doc:`NURBS curve "
"selection </modeling/curves/editing/introduction>`. The basic tools are the "
"same as with :doc:`meshes </modeling/meshes/selecting/introduction>`, so "
"you can select a simple control point with a :kbd:`LMB`\\ -click, add to "
"current selection with :kbd:`Shift-LMB` clicks, :kbd:`B` order-select, and "
"so on."

"This option works a bit like :ref:`edge loop selection <modeling-meshes-"
"selecting-edge-loops>` for meshes, inasmuch it selects a whole :ref:`row "
"<modeling-surfaces-rows-grids>` of control points, based on the active (the "
"last selected) one. The first time you press :kbd:`Shift-R`, the V-row "
"passing through (containing) the active point will be added to the "
"*current* selection. If you use again this shortcut, you will toggle "
"between the U- and V-row of this point, removing *everything else* from the "
