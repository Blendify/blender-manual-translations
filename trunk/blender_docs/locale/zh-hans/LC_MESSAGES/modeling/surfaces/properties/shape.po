"Just like :ref:`NURBS curves <curve-nurbs>`, *Resolution* controls the "
"detail of the surface. The higher the *Resolution* the more detailed and "
"smoother the surface is. The lower the *Resolution* the rougher the surface. "
"However, here you have two resolution settings, one for each interpolation "
"axis (U and V)."

"就像 :ref:`NURBS曲线 <curve-nurbs>`，*分辨率* 控制曲面的细节。*分辨率* 越高，"
