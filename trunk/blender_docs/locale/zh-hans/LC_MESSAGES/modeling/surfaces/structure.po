"Many of the concepts from :doc:`curves </modeling/curves/introduction>`, especially :ref:`NURBS <curve-nurbs>` ones, carry directly over to NURBS surfaces, such as "
"control points, *Order*, *Weight*, *Resolution*, etc. Here we will just talk about the differences."

"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves and NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. Blender internally "
"treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely differently. There are several attributes that separate them but the most important is that a NURBS curve has a single "
"interpolation axis (U) and a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V)."
msgstr ""
"理解NURBS曲线和NURBS曲面之间的差异十分重要：前者具有一个维度，后者有两个。Blender内部对NURBS曲面和NURBS曲面的处理方式是完全不同的。可以通过几个属性将它们区分开，但最重要"
"的是，NURBS曲线仅有一个的插值轴(U)而NURBS曲面有两个插值轴(U和V)。"

"However, you can have \"2D\" surfaces made of curves (using the :doc:`extrusion tools </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, or, to a lesser extent, the filling of "
"closed 2D curves). And you can have \"1D\" curves made of surfaces, like a NURBS surface with only one row (either in U or V direction) of control points produces only "
"a curve..."
msgstr ""
"但是，可以用曲线构成'2D'曲面(使用 :doc:`挤出工具 </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, 或者更简单的, 填充闭合的2D曲线)。并且，可以曲面构成有\"1D\"曲线，比如只有一行"

"Visually you can tell which is which by entering *Edit Mode* and looking at the 3D View header: either the header shows *Surface* or *Curve* as one of the menu choices. "
"Also, you can :doc:`extrude </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>` a whole NURBS surface curve to create a surface, but you cannot with a simple NURBS curve."
msgstr ""
"只要进入 *编辑模式*，看看3D视图的标题栏显示的是曲面还是曲线菜单，就可以从视觉上分辨二者。此外，还可以 :doc:`挤出 </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>` 整条NURBS曲线来"

"\"rows\" and the overall \"grid\"."

msgid ""
"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-mesh-structure-edge-loops>` for "
"meshes). So you have \"U-rows\" and \"V-rows\" in a NURBS surface. The key point is that *all* rows of a given type (U or V) have the *same* number of control points. "
"Each control point belongs to exactly one U-row and one V-row."
msgstr ""
"\"行\"是指在一个插值方向形成的一条\"线\"的一组控制点(有点类似于网格的 :ref:`循环边 <modeling-mesh-structure-edge-loops>` )。所以在一个NURBS曲面里有\"U行\"和\"V行\"。关键"
"是给定类型(U或V)的 *所有行* 都有相同的控制点数量。每个控制点属于一个U行和一个V行。"

"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to a NURBS surface; you have to add a whole U- or V-row at once (in practice, you will usually "
"use the Extrude tool, or perhaps the Duplicate one, to add those...), containing exactly the same number of points as the others. This also means that you will only be "
"able to \"merge\" different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows matches together."
msgstr ""
"重要的是要知道: 不能在NURBS曲面上只添加一个单个的控制点，必须一次添加一整行U或者V行控制点(实际操作中，通常会使用挤出工具或者复制一个, 来添加这些点), 这些点的数量和其他行"

"NURBS can create pure shapes such as circles, cylinders, and spheres (note that a Bézier circle is not a pure circle). To create pure circles, globes, or cylinders, you "

"NURBS能够创建纯粹的形状，比如圆环,圆柱和球(注意贝塞尔圆环不是纯粹的圆形)。为了创建纯粹的圆环、圆球或圆柱, 必须设置具体的控制点的权重值。其中一些作为预设在 *曲线工具* 面"
