"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves "
"and NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. "
"Blender internally treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely "
"differently. There are several attributes that separate them but the most"
" important is that a NURBS curve has a single interpolation axis (U) and "
"a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V)."
msgstr "理解NURBS曲线和NURBS曲面之间的区别非常重要：前者有一个维度，后者有两个维度。Blender内部完全不同地处理NURBS曲面和NURBS曲线。有几个属性区分它们，但最重要的是NURBS曲线有单个插值轴(U)，NURBS曲面有两个插值轴(U和V)。"

"However, you can have \"2D\" surfaces made of curves (using the "

"lesser extent, the filling of closed 2D curves). And you can have \"1D\" "
"curves made of surfaces, like a NURBS surface with only one row (either "
"in U or V direction) of control points produces only a curve..."

"但是，可以用曲线构成“2D”曲面(使用 :doc:`挤出工具 "
"</modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`，或者更简单的，填充闭合的2D曲线)。并且，可以曲面构成“一维”曲线，比如只有一行(在U或V方向)控制点的NURBS曲面，只会生成一条曲线……"

"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one "
"interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-"
"mesh-structure-edge-loops>` for meshes). So you have \"U rows\" and \"V "
"rows\" in a NURBS surface. The key point is that *all* rows of a given "
"type (U or V) have the *same* number of control points. Each control "
"point belongs to exactly one U row and one V row."
msgstr ""
"“行”是指在一个插值方向形成的一条“线”的一组控制点(有点类似于网格的 :ref:`循环边 <modeling-mesh-structure-"

"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to"

"practice, you will usually use the *Extrude* tool, or perhaps the "
"*Duplicate* one, to add those...), containing exactly the same number of "

"\"merge\" different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows "
"matches together."
msgstr ""
"重要的是要知道：不能在NURBS曲面上只添加单个控制点，必须一次添加一整行U或者V行控制点(实际操作中，通常会使用挤出工具或者复制一个, "
"来添加这些点)，这些点的数量和其他行一样。这也意味着，如果至少其中一行匹配在一起，将只能“合并”曲面的不同部分。"
