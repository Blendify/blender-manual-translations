"Many of the concepts from :doc:`curves </modeling/curves/introduction>`, especially :ref:`NURBS <curve-nurbs>` ones, carry directly over to NURBS surfaces, such as "

"It is very important to understand the difference between NURBS curves and NURBS surfaces: the first one has one dimension, the latter has two. Blender internally "
"treats NURBS surfaces and NURBS curves completely differently. There are several attributes that separate them but the most important is that a NURBS curve has a single "
"interpolation axis (U) and a NURBS surface has two interpolation axes (U and V)."

"非常重要的是理解NURBS曲线和NURBS曲面之间的差异：第一个具有一个维度，后者有两个。Blender对待NURBS曲面和NURBS曲面本质上完全不同. 有几个属性将它们区分开，但最重要的是，"

"However, you can have \"2D\" surfaces made of curves (using the :doc:`extrusion tools </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, or, to a lesser extent, the filling of "

"然而, 你可以用曲线构成'2D'曲面(使用 :doc:`挤出工具 </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, 或者在更小的, 填补封闭的2D曲线). 而且你可以有\"1D\"曲线作出的曲面, 就像NURBS"

"Visually you can tell which is which by entering *Edit Mode* and looking at the 3D View header: either the header shows *Surface* or *Curve* as one of the menu choices. "

"A \"row\" is a set of control points forming one \"line\" in one interpolation direction (a bit similar to :ref:`edge loops <modeling-mesh-structure-edge-loops>` for "
"meshes). So you have \"U-rows\" and \"V-rows\" in a NURBS surface. The key point is that *all* rows of a given type (U or V) have the *same* number of control points. "
"Each control point belongs to exactly one U-row and one V-row."
msgstr ""
"\"行\"是一套控制点在一个插值轴形成的一条\"线\"(有点类似于网格的 :ref:`循环边 <modeling-mesh-structure-edge-loops>` ). 所以你在一个NURBS曲面里有\"U行\"和\"V行\"。关键是给"

"This is very important to grasp: you cannot add a single control point to a NURBS surface; you have to add a whole U- or V-row at once (in practice, you will usually "
"use the Extrude tool, or perhaps the Duplicate one, to add those...), containing exactly the same number of points as the others. This also means that you will only be "
"able to \"merge\" different pieces of surfaces if at least one of their rows matches together."
msgstr ""
"重要的是要知道: 你不能在NURBS曲面上只添加一个单个的控制点, 你必须一次添加一整个U或者V行控制点, (实践中, 你会经常使用挤出工具或者复制一个, 来添加这些点), 这些点的数量和别"
