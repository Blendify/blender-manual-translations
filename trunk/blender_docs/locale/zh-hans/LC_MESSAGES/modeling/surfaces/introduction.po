"have NURBS surfaces, no Bézier (you have the *Bézier* knot type, though; see below), nor polygonal "

"You may ask yourself \"but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only 2D?\". In order to be 3D, "
"the object needs to have \"Volume\", and a surface, even when it is closed, does not have volume; "
"it is infinitely thin. If it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third dimension). "
"Hence, it is only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation dimensions or axes or coordinates (if "
"you know a bit of math, think of non-euclidean geometry -- well, surfaces are just non-euclidean 2D "
"planes...). To take a more \"real-world\" example, you can roll a sheet of paper to create a "
"cylinder; well, even if it \"draws\" a volume, the sheet itself will remain a (nearly...) 2D object!"
