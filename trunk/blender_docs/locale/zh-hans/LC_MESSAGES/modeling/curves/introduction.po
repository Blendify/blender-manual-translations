"Both Bézier and NURBS curves are named after their mathematical definitions, and choosing between them is often more "
"a matter of how they are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's perspective. Bézier curves "
"are generally more intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBS curves are more "
"efficient for the computer to calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that curves are defined by less data and so can "
"produce results using less memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural approach to surfaces "
"can increase demands at render time."
