"mathematical functions rather than a series of points."

"Blender offers both :ref:`curve-bezier` and :ref:`curve-nurbs`. Both Bézier curves and NURBS curves and surfaces are defined in "

"Both Bézier and NURBs curves are named after their mathematical definitions, and choosing between them is often more a matter of "
"how they are computed behind the scenes than how they appear from a modeler's perspective. Bézier curves are generally more "
"intuitive because they start and end at the control points that you set, but NURBs curves are more efficient for the computer to "
"calculate when there are many twists and turns in a curve."
msgstr ""
"贝塞尔曲线和NURBs曲线都是以他们的数学定义所命名，选择使用哪种曲线往往更多的是考虑他们的后台计算方式而不是从建模者的直观角度考虑。"
"贝塞尔曲线通常更直观,因为它们在你设置的控制点上开始和结束,但NURBs曲线在描述有许多波折的曲线上更高效。"

"The main advantage to using curves instead of polygonal meshes is that curves are defined by less data and so can produce results "
"using less memory and storage space at modeling time. However, this procedural approach to surfaces can increase demands at "
"render time."

"使用曲线代替多边形网格的主要优势是,曲线使用更少的数据来描述物体结构,所以在建模时可以使用更少的内存和存储空间来产生结果。然而，此方"

"Certain modeling techniques, such as :doc:`extruding a profile along a path </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, are possible "

"necessary, :doc:`mesh editing </modeling/meshes/editing/introduction>` may be a better modeling option."
msgstr ""
"某些建模技术,如 :doc:`extruding a profile along a path </modeling/curves/properties/geometry>`, 可能只能使用曲线。另一方面,当使用"
