"By default, new curves are set to be 3D, which means that control points "
"can be placed anywhere in 3D space. Curves can also be set to 2D which "
"constrain the control points to the curve's local XY axis."

"The *resolution* property defines the number of points that are computed "
"between every pair of control points. Curves can be made more or less "
"smooth by increasing and decreasing the resolution respectively. The "
"*Preview U* setting determines the resolution in the 3D View while the "
"*Render U* setting determines the curve's render resolution. If *Render "
"U* is set to zero (0), then the *Preview U* setting is used for both the "
"3D View and render resolution."

msgid ""
"A 3D curve has control points that are not located on the curve's local "
"XY plane. This gives the curve a twist which can affect the curve "
"normals. You can alter how the twist of the curve is calculated by "
"choosing from *Minimum, Tangent* and *Z-Up* options from the select menu."
