"Splines are a substructure of curves and are the individual elements that"
" make curve objects. A curve object can be composed of several different "
"splines, just like mesh objects can have different discontinuous meshes "
"under the same object. A spline defines the shape of the curve and can be"
" transformed by altering its `Control Points`_. Splines come in three "
"distinct types, which are described in `Spline Types`_. Each spline type "
"has a slightly different algorithm for computing how bends in the spline "
"are represented."

"N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation for Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. One of"

"*approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* circle."
" NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an introduction, "

"NURBS是Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines的缩写。 "
"贝塞尔物体和NURBS物体之间的主要区别之一是，贝塞尔曲线是近似值。例如，一个贝塞尔圆是一个 *近似* 的圆，而一个NURBS圆是一个 *精确* "
