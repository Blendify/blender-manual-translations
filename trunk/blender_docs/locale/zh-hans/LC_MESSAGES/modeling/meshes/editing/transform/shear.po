"Shearing is a form of movement where parallel surfaces move past one another. "
"During this transform, movement of the selected elements will occur along the "
"horizontal axis of the current view. The axis location will be defined by "
"the :doc:`Pivot Point </editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/"
"pivot_point/index>`. Everything that is \"above\" this axis will move (Shear) "
"in the same direction as your mouse pointer (but always parallel to the "
"horizontal axis). Everything that is \"below\" the horizontal axis will move "
"in the opposite direction."

"切变是两个平行表面的相向运动。执行该变换时，选中元素会沿着当前视图的水平轴向移"
"动。轴线位置由 :doc:`轴心点 </editors/3dview/object/editing/transform/control/"

"interactively by moving the mouse or by typing a number. Pressing :kbd:"
"`Return` will confirm the transformation. The confirmed transformation can be "
