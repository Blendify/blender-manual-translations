"The Mesh Deform modifier is reasonably easy to use but it can be very slow "
"to do the calculations needed to properly map the deform mesh cage to the "
"deformed object."

msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/modeling/modifiers/deform/mesh_deform.rst:30
msgid ""
"Links the current vertex positions of both the modified geometry and the "
"deformer *Object* chosen together. An unbound Mesh Deform modifier has no "
"effect - it must be bound so that altering the shape of the deform mesh cage"
" actually alters the shape of the modified object."

msgid ""
"Depending on the settings of the Mesh Deform modifier and complexity of the "
"deform mesh cage and/or deformed object, it can take a long time for this "
"operation to complete. This can result in Blender not responding to user's "
"actions until it has completed."

msgid ""
"When a deformed object has been associated to a deform mesh cage, it can "
"later be disassociated by clicking the *Unbind* button which replaced the "
"*Bind* one. When *Unbind* is clicked, the *deform mesh cage* will keep its "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *Precision* numeric slider field controls the accuracy with which the "
"deform mesh cage alters the deformed object, when the points on the cage are"
" moved. Raising this value higher can greatly increase the time it takes the"
" *Mesh Deform* modifier to complete its binding calculations, but it will "
"get more accurate cage mapping to the deformed object."

"These can be reduced by binding with a higher *Precision*, however it is a "

"Besides the outer cage, more faces within the cage, either loose or forming "
