"An object or bone can be scaled along the X, Y and Z axes. This constraint "
"restricts the amount of allowed scalings along each axis, through lower and "
"upper bounds."

msgid ""
"This constraint does not tolerate negative scale values (those you might use"
" to mirror an object...): when you add it to an object or bone, even if no "
"axis limit is enabled, nor the *For Transform* button, as soon as you scale "
"your object, all negative scale values are instantaneously inverted to "
"positive ones... And the boundary settings can only take strictly positive "
"values."

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the visual "
"and rendered scale of its owner, its owner's data block still allows (by "
"default) the object or bone to have scale values outside the minimum and "
"maximum ranges (as long as they remain positive!). This can be seen in its "
"*Transform Properties* panel (:kbd:`N`). When an owner is scaled and "
"attempted to be moved outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained "
"to those boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, its "
"coordinates will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is "
"removed, its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally-specified scale."

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal scale that is beyond the limits, "
"scaling it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing until the "
"internal scale values are back within the limit threshold (unless you "
"enabled the *For Transform* option, see below - or your owner has some "
"negative scale values)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis locks the owner's scaling "
"along that axis. Although this is possible, using the *Transformation "
"Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier."

"These buttons enable the lower boundary for the scale of the owner along "
"respectively the X, Y and Z axes of the chosen *Space*. The *Min* and *Max* "
"numeric fields to their right control the value of their lower and upper "
"boundaries, respectively. Note that if a min value is higher than its "
"corresponding max value, the constraint behaves as if it had the same value "
"as the max one."

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, and except for the"
" negative values, the owner can still have scales out of bounds (as shown by"
" the *Transform Properties* panel). Well, when you enable this button, this "
"is no longer possible - the owner transform properties are also limited by "
"the constraint. Note however that the constraint does not directly modify "
"the scale values: you have to scale its owner one way or another for this to"
" take effect."
