"The *Rigid Body Joint* constraint is very special. Basically, it is used by "
"the physical part of the Blender Game Engine to simulate a joint between its"
" owner and its target. It offers four joint types: hinge type, ball-and-"
"socket type, cone-twist, and generic six-DoF (degrees of freedom) type."

"The joint point and axes are defined and fixed relative to the owner. The "
"target moves as if it were stuck to the center point of a stick, the other "
"end of the stick rotating around the joint/pivot point..."

"This constraint is of no use in most \"standard\" static or animated "
"projects. However, you can use its results outside of the BGE, through the "
":menuselection:`Game --> Record Animation` menu entry (from the main menu of"
" the *User Preferences* window, see :doc:`Rigid Bodies "
"</game_engine/physics/using_ge>` for more info on this topic)."
