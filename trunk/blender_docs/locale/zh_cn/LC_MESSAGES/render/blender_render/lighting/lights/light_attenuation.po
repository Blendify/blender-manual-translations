"In (*Sphere* *with* ``10``), the clipping sphere's radius is ``10`` units, "
"which means the light's intensity is also being controlled by ``10`` units "
"of distance. With a linear attenuation, the light's intensity has fallen "
"very low even before it gets to the first object."

"If a *Lamp* light is set to not cast shadows, it illuminates through walls "
"and the like. If you want to achieve some nice effects like a fire, or a "
"candle-lit room interior seen from outside a window, the *Sphere* option is "
"a must. By carefully working on the *Distance* value you can make your warm "
"firelight shed only within the room, while illuminating outside with a cool "
"moonlight, the latter achieved with a *Sun* or *Hemi* light or both."
