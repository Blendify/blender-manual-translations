"The Origin of an Object is shown in the 3D view by a small orange circle. "

"While the Origin is equivalent to the center of the *Object*, it does not "
"have to be located in the center of the *Mesh*. This means that an Object "

"Origin located on the far left of the mesh."

"In Edit mode, setting the Pivot Point to Individual Origins produces "
"different results when the selection mode is set to Vertex, Edge or Face. "
"For example, Vertex mode produces results similar to setting the pivot point"
" to median and Edge mode often produces distorted results. Using Individual "
"Origins in Face mode produces the most predictable results."
