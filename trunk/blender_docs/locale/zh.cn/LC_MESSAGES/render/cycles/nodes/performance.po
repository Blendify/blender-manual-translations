"In order to make creating node shaders more convenient, Cycles applies a "
"number of optimizations both at compile time and runtime. By exploiting "
"them it is possible to design complicated \"Uber Shader\" style node "
"groups that incur minimal render time overhead for unused features."

"As the first step in preparing a node shader for execution, Cycles "
"expands all node groups, as if using the Ungroup command, and discards UI"
" only features like frames and reroute nodes."

"Detect Mix RGB, Math and Vector Math nodes that become no-op (without "
"Clamp) or evaluate to 0 as a result of addition, subtraction, "

"When executing shaders, a special optimization is applied to Mix Shader "
"nodes. If Fac evaluates to 0 or 1, any nodes that are only reachable via "

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/nodes/performance.rst:57
msgid ""
"If Open Shading Language is chosen as the rendering back-end, node "
"shaders are translated to OSL code and then compiled and executed by the "
"OSL runtime. In the process it applies its own extensive set of "
"optimizations, both at compile time and runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/nodes/performance.rst:61
msgid ""
"Open Shading Language can optimize out Script nodes if their outputs are "
"unused or constant, even if their OSL shaders have side effects like "
"debug tracing and message passing, which may be confusing. For that "
"reason message passing with `setmessage` and `getmessage` should "
"generally not be used for passing information forward in the graph; "
"explicitly passing information through sockets should be preferred."
