msgstr "循环在编译时和运行时都应用一些着色器节点优化。利用它们可以设计复杂的 \"超级材质\" 风格的节点组，这些对未使用的特性引发最小的渲染时间开销。"

msgid "As the first step in preparing a node shader for execution, Cycles expands all node groups, as if using the Ungroup tool, and discards UI only features like frames and reroute nodes."
msgstr "作为准备节点着色器执行的第一步，循环展开全部的节点组，就像使用取消组工具，丢弃UI 只剩像框架和重新路由节点的特性。"

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/optimizations/nodes.rst:56
msgid "If Open Shading Language is chosen as the rendering back-end, node shaders are translated to OSL code and then compiled and executed by the OSL runtime. In the process it applies its own extensive set of optimizations, both at compile time and runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/render/cycles/optimizations/nodes.rst:60
msgid "Open Shading Language can optimize out Script nodes if their outputs are unused or constant, even if their OSL shaders have side effects like debug tracing and message passing, which may be confusing. For that reason message passing with ``setmessage`` and ``getmessage`` should generally not be used for passing information forward in the graph; explicitly passing information through sockets should be preferred."
