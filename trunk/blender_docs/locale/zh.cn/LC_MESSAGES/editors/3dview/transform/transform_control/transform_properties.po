"The *Transform Properties* section in the *View Properties* panel allows you"

"properties of an object, in *Object* mode. In *Edit* mode, it mainly allows "
"you to enter precise coordinates for a vertex, or median position for a "
"group of vertices (including an edge/face). As each type of object has a "
"different set of options in its *Transform Properties* panel in *Edit* mode,"
