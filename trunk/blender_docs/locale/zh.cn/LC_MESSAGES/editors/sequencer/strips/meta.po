"Meta-Strips are a kind of organization tool. For example, if you are "
"using a lot of strips and they are complicated the the interface you can "
"group them together using Meta-Strips. A Meta-Strip spans from the "
"beginning of the first strip to the end of the last one, and condenses "
"all channels into a single strip. Separating (ungrouping) them restores "
"them to their relative positions and channels. To create a Meta-Strip "
"select all the strips you want to group, and :kbd:`Ctrl-G` to group them."
" If you choose to delete a Meta-Strip and want to keep the strips inside,"
" use :kbd:`Alt-G`."

"After creating a Meta-Strip it is also possible to edit the contents "
"inside a Meta-Strip. To do this select the desired Meta-strip and press "
":kbd:`Tab`. Once you are done editing the contents inside a Meta-Strip "
"press :kbd:`Tab` again to exit the Meta-Strip. Meta-Strips can also be "
"nested, which make editing them a little confusing. To exit out one level"
" of Meta-Strip make sure you do not have a Meta-Strip selected when you "
"press :kbd:`Tab`."

"The default blend mode for a Meta strip is Replace. There are many cases "
"where this alters the results of the animation so be sure to check the "
"results and adjust the blend mode if necessary."

"One convenient use for Meta-Strips is when you want to apply the same "
"effect to multiple strips. For example: if you have a video that was "
"recorded in different files and want to add an effect strip. It is much "
"more convenient to apply a single set of effects to one Meta-Strip then "
"applying it to each individual strip."
