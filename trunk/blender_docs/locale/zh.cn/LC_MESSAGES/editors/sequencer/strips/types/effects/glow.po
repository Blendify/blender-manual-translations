"This effect makes parts of an image glow brighter by working on the "
"luminance channel of an image. The *Glow* is the superposition of the "
"base image and a modified version, where some areas (brighter than the "
"*Threshold:*) are blurred. With the *Glow* strip properties, you control "
"this *Threshold:*, the maximum luminosity that can be added (*Clamp:*), a"
" *Boost factor:* for it, the size of the blur (*Blur distance:*), and its"
" *Quality:*. The *Only boost* button allows you to only show/use the "
"\"modified\" version of the image, without the base one. To \"animate\" "
"the glow effect, mix it with the base image using the Gamma Cross effect,"
" crossing from the base image to the glowing one."
