"The wipe effect is a type of transition strip. It can be used to transition "
"from one strip to the next. The wipe will have no effect if created from a "
"single strip instead of two strips. The duration of the wipe is the "
"intersection of the two source strips and can not be adjusted. To adjust the"
" start and end of the wipe you must adjust the temporal bounds of the source"
" strips in a way that alters their intersection."
