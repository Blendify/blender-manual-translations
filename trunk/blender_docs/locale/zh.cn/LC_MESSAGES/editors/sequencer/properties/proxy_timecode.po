"A proxy is a smaller image (faster to load) that stands in for the main "
"image. When you Rebuild proxy Blender computes small images (like "
"thumbnails) for the big images and may take some time. After computing them,"
" though, editing functions like scrubbing and scrolling and compositing "
"functions like cross using these proxies is much faster but gives a low-res "
"result. Disable proxies before final rendering."

"When you're working with footage directly copied from a camera without pre-"
"processing it, there might be bunch of artifacts, mostly due to seeking a "
"given frame in sequence. This happens because such footage usually doesn't "
"have correct frame rate values in their headers. So, for Blender to "
"calculate the position of a needed frame in the stream works inaccurately "
"and can give errant result. There are two possible ways to avoid this:"
