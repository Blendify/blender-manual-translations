"In addition to modeling and animation, Blender has a fully functional "
"Video Sequence Editor (VSE) as well as an advanced :doc:`Compositor "
"</compositing/introduction>` that also manipulates a video stream. The "
"VSE within Blender is a complete video editing system that allows you to "
"combine multiple video channels and add effects to them. You can use "
"these effects to create powerful video edits (especially when you combine"
" it with the animation power of Blender!)."

"To use the VSE, you load multiple video clips and lay them end-to-end (or"
" in some cases, overlay them), inserting fades and transitions to link "
"the end of one clip to the beginning of another. Finally, you can audio "
"and synchronize the timing of the video sequence to match it."
msgstr "利用VSE，你加载多个视频剪辑并且将他们头尾相接（或在某些情况下，进行覆盖），插入一个过渡衔接效果给相连接的2个视频首尾，最后，添加一个音频轨道，这样你就可以匹配时间上的视频来匹配音轨。OK了我们用VSE剪辑了一个小电影啦。"

"The Video Sequence Editor has a header (where the menu and view modes are"

"The first channel `0` is unusable as a place to put strips. This is "

"through 7 are shown). You can scale the time using the zoom keys or mouse"
