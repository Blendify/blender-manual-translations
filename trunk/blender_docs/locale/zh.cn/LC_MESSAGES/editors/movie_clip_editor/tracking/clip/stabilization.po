"To detect spurious movement in a given shot, we'll assume a simplified "

"this simplified approach works surprisingly well even with rather "

"To compensate movement according to this simplified model, the 2D "
"stabilizer proceeds in two steps. First we try to detect the translation "
"offset from the weighted average of all *translation tracking points*. "
"After compensating this translation component, we then use additional "
"*rotation/scale tracking points* to detect rotation around a given pivot "

"In the current version, the **pivot point** is anchored to the *weight "

"Thus, as foundation for any image stabilization, we need tracked image "

"can be established with Blender's :doc:`image feature tracking component "
"<introduction>` The right choice of points to track is somewhat tricky, "
"yet crucial for successful image stabilization. Often, we're here because"
" we'll have to deal with imperfect footage. In such cases, the *averaging"
" of tracks* helps to work around image or tracking errors at some point. "

"When talking about the movement stabilization of video, we have to "
"distinguish several frames of reference. The image elements featured by "
"the footage move around irregularly within the footage's **original image"
" boundaries** -- this is the very reason why we are using the stabilizer."
" When our attempt at stabilization was successful, the image elements can"
" be considered *stable* now, while in exchange the footage's image "
"boundaries have taken on irregular movement and jump around in the "
"opposite way. This is the immediate consequence of the stabilizer's "
"activity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/clip/stabilization.rst:90
msgid ""
"Since the actual image elements, i.e the subject of our footage can be "
"considered stable now, we may use these as a new frame of reference: we "
"consider them attached to a fixed backdrop, which we call the **canvas**."
" Introducing this concept of a \"canvas\" helps to deal with deliberate "
"movements of the camera. And beyond that, it yields an additional "
"benefit: It is very frequent for the pixels of video footage to be *non "
"square.* So we have to stretch and expand those pixels, before we're able"
" to preform any sensible rotation stabilization. Thus the canvas becomes,"
" by definition, the reference for an undistorted display of the image "
"contents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/editors/movie_clip_editor/tracking/clip/stabilization.rst:97
msgid ""
"But when the camera was *moved intentionally,* we have to consider yet "
"another frame of reference beyond the canvas: namely the frame (or "
"*\"cadre\"*) of the **final image** we want to create. To understand this"
" distinction, let's consider a hand-held, panning shot to the right: "
"Since our camera was turned towards the right side, the actual image "
"contents move towards the left side *within* the original image frame. "
"But let's assume the stabilizer was successful with \"fixing\" any image "
"contents relative to the *canvas* -- which in turn means, that the "
"original image boundaries start to move irregularly towards the right "
"side, and the *contents* of the image will begin to disappear gradually "
"behind the left boundary of the original image. After some amount of "
"panning, we'll have lost all of our original contents and just see an "
"empty black image backdrop. The only solution to deal with that problem "
"is to *move the final image frame along to the right,* thus following the"
" originally intended panning movement. Of course, this time, we do want "
"to perform this newly added panning movement in a smooth and clean way."

"To allow for such a compensation and to reintroduce deliberate panning, "

"dedicated set of controls: *Expected position*, *Expected rotation* and "
"*Expected scale*. These act like the controls of a virtual camera filming"
" the contents we have fixed onto the canvas. By *animating* those "
"parameters, we're able to perform all kinds of deliberate camera "
"movements in a smooth fashion."

msgid ""
"As explained above, when we succeed with stabilizing the image contents, "
"the boundaries of the original footage start to jump around in the "
"opposite direction of the movements compensated. This is inevitable -- "
"yet very annoying, since due to the irregular nature of these movements, "
"these \"dancing black borders\" tend to draw away attention from the "
"actual subject and introduce an annoying restlessness. Thus our goal must"
" be to hide those dancing borders as good as possible. A simple solution "
"is to add a small amount of zoom. Sometimes we'll also need to animate "
"the parameter *Expected position* in order to keep the image centered as "
"good as we can -- this helps to reduce the amount of zoom necessary to "
"remove those annoying borders."

"The **Autoscale function** can be used to find the minimal amount of zoom"
" just sufficient to remove those black borders completely. However, if "
"the camera jumps a lot, the autoscale function often zooms in too much, "
"especially since this calculation aims at finding a single, static zoom "
"factor for the whole duration of the footage. When this happens, you'll "
"typically get overall better results with animating both the zoom factor "

"The stabilizer is able to deal with gaps and partial coverage within the "
"given tracks. However, the basic assumption is that each track covers a "
"single, fixed reference point whenever there is any usable/enabled data. "
"Thus, you must not \"re-use\" a given track to follow several different "
"points, rather you should disable and thus end one track, when tracking "
"this feature is no longer feasible. You may include \"gaps\", when a "
"tracking point is temporarily disabled or unavailable, but you should "
"start a new track for each distinct new feature to be tracked."

"Each track contributes to the overall result by the degree controlled "
"through its *Stab Weight* parameter. It is evaluated on a per frame base,"
" which enables us to control the influence of a track by *animating* this"
" *Stab Weight*. You may imagine the overall working of the stabilizer as "
"if each tracking point \"drags\" the image through a flexible spring: "
"When you turn down the *Stab Weight* of a tracking point, you decrease "
"the amount of \"drag\" it creates. Sometimes the contribution of "
"different tracks has to work partially counter each other. This effect "
"might be used to cancel out spurious movement, e.g. as caused by "
"perspective. But when, in such a situation, one of the involved tracks "
"suddenly goes away, a jump in image position or rotation might be the "
"result. Thus, whenever we notice a jump at the very frame where some "
"partially covered track starts or ends, we need to soften the transition."
" We do so by animating the *Stab Weight* gradually down, so that it "
"reaches zero at the boundary point. In a similar vein, when we plan a "
"\"handover\" between several partially covered tracks, we define a "
"*cross-fade* over the duration where the tracks overlap, again by "
"animating the *Stab Weight* parameters accordingly. But even with such "
"cross-fade smoothing, some residual movement might remain, which then "
"needs to be corrected with the *Expected Position* or *Expected rotation*"
" parameters. It is crucial to avoid \"overshooting\" movements in such a "
"situation -- always strive at setting the animation keyframes onto "
"precisely the same frame number for all the tracks and parameters "
"involved."
