"Curves are 2D objects, and surfaces are their 3D extension. Note however, that in Blender, you only have NURBS surfaces, no Bézier (you have the *Bézier* knot type, though; see below), nor polygonal (but for these, you "
"have meshes!). Even though curves and surfaces share the same object type (with texts also...), they are not the same thing; for example, you cannot have in the same object both curves and surfaces."

"曲线是2D物体，曲面是其3D扩展，在Blender里，只有NURBS曲面，没有贝塞尔曲面，也没有曲面多边形（可以使用网格构建多边形），尽管曲线和曲面拥有同样的物体类型，但它们不是同一样东西，比如，同一个物体里不可能既有曲线，又有曲面。（译"

"As surfaces are 2D, they have two interpolation axes, U (as for curves) and V. It is important to understand that you can control the interpolation rules (knot, order, resolution) *independently* for each of these two "
"dimensions (the U and V fields for all these settings, of course)."
msgstr "曲面同样是2D的，他有两个插值坐标轴，U（类似于曲线中的）和V坐标轴，你可以独立控制两个坐标轴（U和V的设置）的插值规则（节点，阶数，分辨率）。"

"You may ask yourself \"but the surface appears to be 3D, why is it only 2D?\". In order to be 3D, the object needs to have \"Volume\", and a surface, even when it is closed, does not have volume; it is infinitely thin. If "
"it had a volume the surface would have a thickness (its third dimension). Hence, it is only a 2D object, and has only two interpolation dimensions or axes or coordinates (if you know a bit of math, think of non-euclidean "
"geometry -- well, surfaces are just non-euclidean 2D planes...). To take a more \"real life\" example, you can roll a sheet of paper to create a cylinder; well, even if it \"draws\" a volume, the sheet itself will remain a "
"(nearly...) 2D object!"

"你可能会觉得曲面看起来是3D的啊，为什么实际上他是2D的呢？如果要让一个物体是3D的，物体必须拥有一个“体积”和面。然而曲面就算是封闭的，他也没有体积，他是无限薄的。如果想要形成体积，曲面必须拥有厚度（既第三维），因此，曲面仅仅是"
"个2D物体，只有两维插值坐标轴（如果你知道一些数学知识，想想关于非欧几何体的知识，事实上，曲面就是非欧二维面），举个现实点的例子，把一张纸卷成个圆筒，就算它围出了一个体积，然而，纸本身还是一个二维物体。"
