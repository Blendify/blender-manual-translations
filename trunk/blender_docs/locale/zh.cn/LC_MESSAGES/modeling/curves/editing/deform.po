"*Curve Deform* provides a simple but efficient method of defining a "
"deformation on a mesh. By parenting a mesh object to a curve, you can deform"
" the mesh up or down the curve by moving the mesh along, or orthogonal to, "
"the dominant axis. This is a most useful tool to make an object follow a "
"complex path, like e.g. a sheet of paper inside a printer, a film inside a "
"camera, the water of a canal..."

"The *Curve Deform* works on a (global) dominant axis, X, Y, or Z. This means"
" that when you move your mesh in the dominant direction, the mesh will "
"traverse along the curve. Moving the mesh in an orthogonal direction will "
"move the mesh object closer or further away from the curve. The default "
"settings in Blender map the Y axis to the dominant axis. When you move the "
"object beyond the curve endings the object will continue to deform based on "
"the direction vector of the curve endings."

"If the \"curve path\" is *3D*, the *Tilt* value of its control points will "
"be used (see the :doc:`Extrusion </modeling/curves/editing/extrude>` section"
" above) to twist the \"curved\" object around it. Unfortunately, the other "
"*Radius* property is not used (it would have been possible, for example, to "
"make it control the size of the \"curved\" object...)."

"Try to position your object over the curve immediately after you have added "

"The *Curve Deform* relationship is now also a modifier, called :doc:`Curve "

"same as its counterpart, except that when the modifier is used, the "
"\"dominant axis\" is set inside its properties - and the *Track X* / *Y* / "
"*Z* buttons no longer have an effect on it. And you have some goodies, like "
"the possibility, if \"curving\" a mesh, to only curve one of its vertex "
"groups..."
