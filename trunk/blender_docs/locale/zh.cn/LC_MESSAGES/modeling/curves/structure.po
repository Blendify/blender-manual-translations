"The main elements used in editing Bézier Curves are the Control Points "
"and Handles. A Segment (the actual Curve) is found between two Control "
"Points. Handles define the curvature of the curve."

"In the image below, the Control Points can be found in the middle of the "
"pink line, while the Handles comprise the extensions from the Control "
"Point. By default the arrows on the Segment represents the direction and "
"*relative* speed and direction of movement Objects will have when moving "
"along the curve. This can be altered by defining a custom F-Curve."

"This handle has a completely automatic length and direction which is set "

"Both parts of a handle always point to the previous handle or the next "

"N.U.R.B.S. is the abbreviation of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines. One of "
"the major differences between Bézier Objects and NURBS Objects is that "
"Bézier Curves are approximations. For example, a Bézier circle is an "
"*approximation* of a circle, whereas a NURBS circle is an *exact* circle."
" NURBS theory can be a *very* complicated topic. For an introduction, "
"please consult the `Wikipedia page. "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NURBS>`__."
