"As previously noted, bones' transformations are performed based on the "

"Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one "

" is especially important when using axis locking, for example, there is "
"no specific \"bone roll\" tool in *Pose Mode*, as you can rotate around "

"When you pose your armature, you are supposed to have one or more objects"

" skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very "
