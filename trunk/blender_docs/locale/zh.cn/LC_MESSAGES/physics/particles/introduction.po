"Particles are lots of items emitted from mesh objects, typically in the "
"thousands. Each particle can be a point of light or a mesh, and be joined or"
" dynamic. They may react to many different influences and forces, and have "
"the notion of a lifespan. Dynamic particles can represent fire, smoke, mist,"
" and other things such as dust or magic spells."
