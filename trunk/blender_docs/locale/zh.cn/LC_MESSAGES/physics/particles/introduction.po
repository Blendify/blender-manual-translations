"Particles are lots of items emitted from mesh objects, typically in the "
"thousands. Each particle can be a point of light or a mesh, and be joined"
" or dynamic. They may react to many different influences and forces, and "
"have the notion of a lifespan. Dynamic particles can represent fire, "
"smoke, mist, and other things such as dust or magic spells."
