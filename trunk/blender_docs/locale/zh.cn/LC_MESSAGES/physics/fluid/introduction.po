"While modeling a scene with blender, certain objects can be marked to "
"participate in the fluid simulation, e.g. as fluid or as an obstacle. The "
"bounding box of another object will be used to define a box-shaped region to"
" simulate the fluid in (the so called \"simulation domain\"). The global "
"simulation parameters (such as viscosity and gravity) can be set for this "
"domain object."

"Using the *BAKE* button, the geometry and settings are exported to the "
"simulator and the fluid simulation is performed, generating a surface mesh "
"together with a preview for each animation frame, and saving them to hard "
"disk. Then the appropriate fluid surface for the current frame is loaded "
"from disk and displayed or rendered."
