"A new type of Ipo Curve, *FluidSim*, is available for fluid domain objects. "
"Unlike most other animatable values in Blender, *FluidSim* Ipos cannot be "
"keyframed by simply using the :kbd:`I` key; you must manually set values by "
"clicking in the Ipo window. In order to set a keyframe, you must select the "
"property you wish to animate in the Ipo window and :kbd:`Ctrl-LMB` click to "
"set the keyframe to the desired location in the Ipo window."

"Note that you do not have to be exact on where you click; we recommend that "
"after you set the control point, open the *Transform Properties* panel "
"(:kbd:`N`) and round the X value to a whole frame number, and then set the Y"
" value that you wish."

"A multiplicative factor in the fluid's viscosity coefficient. It must be set"

"Changes the speed of the simulation; like the Speed Control in the VSE can "
"speed up or slow down a video, this curve can speed up or slow down the "
"fluid motion during a frame sequence. If the value for *Fac-Tim* is less "
"than or equal to zero, time (and the fluid) stands still; the fluid freezes."
" For values between 0.0 and 1.0, the fluid runs slower and will look "
"thicker. 1.0 is normal fluid motion, and values greater than 1.0 will make "
"the fluid flow faster, possibly appearing thinner."

"The XYZ vector for gravity changes; aka inertia of the fluid itself (think "

"When Active transitions from 0.0 to something greater than 0 (such as "
"between 0.1 and 1.0), the object's function (designated as an *Inflow*, or "
"*Outflow*, etc.) resumes its effect. Crossing down to 0.0 and then at some "
"point, back up, re-establishes the effect and the resulting fluid sim. Use "
"this for dripping, or any kind of intermittent inflow. This active status "
"also works for objects designated as *Outflow* and *Obstacle*, so you can "
"also simulate (for example) a drain plugging up."
