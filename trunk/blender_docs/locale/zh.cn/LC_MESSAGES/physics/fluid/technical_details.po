"Fluid animation can take a lot of time - the better you understand how it "
"works, the easier it will be to estimate how the results will look. The "
"algorithm used for Blender's fluid simulation is the *Lattice Boltzmann "
"Method* (LBM); other fluid algorithms include *Navier-Stokes* (NS) solvers "
"and *Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics* (SPH) methods. LBM lies somewhere "
"between these two."

"The viscosity of water is already really low, so especially for small "
"resolutions, the turbulence of water can not be correctly captured. If you "
"look closely, most simulations of fluids in computer graphics do not yet "
"look like real water as of now. Generally, don't rely on the physical "
"settings too much (such as physical domain size or length of the animation "
"in seconds). Rather try to get the overall motion right with a low "
"resolution, and then increase the resolution as much as possible or desired."

"The integration of the fluid simulator was done as a Google Summer-of-Code "
"project. More information about the solver can be found at `www.ntoken.com "
"<http://graphics.ethz.ch/~thuereyn/ntoken3/Publications.html>`__. These "
"Animations were created with the solver before its integration into blender:"
" `Adaptive Grids <http://www10.informatik.uni-"

"`Interactive Animations <http://www10.informatik.uni-"

" Chris Want for organizing the Blender-SoC projects, and to Jonathan Merrit "
"for mentoring this one! And of course thanks to Google for starting the "
"whole thing... SoC progress updates were posted here: `SoC-Blenderfluid-Blog"
