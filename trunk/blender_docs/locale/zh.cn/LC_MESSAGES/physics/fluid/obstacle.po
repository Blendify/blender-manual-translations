"This object will be used as an obstacle in the simulation. As with a fluid "
"object, obstacle objects currently should not intersect. As for fluid "
"objects, the actual mesh geometry is used for obstacles. For objects with a "
"volume, make sure that the normals of the obstacle are calculated correctly,"
" and radiating properly (use the *Flip Normal* button, in *Edit mode*, *Mesh"
" Tools* panel, *Editing* context), particularly when using a spinned "
"container. Applying the Modifier *SubSurf* before baking the simulation "
"could also be a good idea if the mesh is not animated."
