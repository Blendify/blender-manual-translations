msgid ""
"The Distance Key node determines a pixels alpha value based on the 3 "
"dimensional distance between the image pixel color and the key color in a 3D"
" RGB color space. This key works well when trying to single out a specific "
"color in a background (not necessarily green). It is also possible to work "
"with YCbCr color space (chroma color space) but only the Cb and Cr channels "
"are taken into consideration for determining the distance between the "
"foreground and background pixels."

"You can adjust the Tolerance for what the node considers a match between the"
" key color and the foreground pixel. The tolerance affects how close a pixel"
" needs to be to the background pixel to be considered an absolute match."

msgid ""
"When the Falloff value is high, pixels that are close to the Key Color are "
"more transparent than pixels that are not as close to the Key Color (but "
"still considered close enough to be keyed). When the Falloff value is low, "
"it does not matter how close the pixel color (Image) is to the Key Color, it"
" is transparent."
