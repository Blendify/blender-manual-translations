#~ "Motion blur is the effect of "
#~ "objects moving so fast they blur. "
#~ "Because CG animations work by rendering"
#~ " individual frames, they have no real"
#~ " knowledge of what was where in "
#~ "the last frame, and where it is"
#~ " now."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "In Blender, there are two ways to"
#~ " produce motion blur. The first "
#~ "method (which produces the most correct"
#~ " results) works by rendering a single"
#~ " frame multiple times with slight "
#~ "time offsets, then accumulating these "
#~ "images together; this is called Motion"
#~ " Blur and is activated on the "
#~ "Render panel. The second (and much "
#~ "faster) method is the Vector Blur "
#~ "Node."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To use, connect the appropriate passes from a Render Result node."

#~ "Make sure to enable the Speed "

#~ "you wish to perform motion blur "
#~ "on."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Because of the way vector blur "
#~ "works, it can produce streaks, lines "
#~ "and other artifacts. These mostly come"
#~ " from pixels moving too fast; to "
#~ "combat these problems, the filter has"
#~ " minimum and maximum speed settings, "
#~ "which can be used to limit which"
#~ " pixels get blurred (e.g. if a "
#~ "pixel is moving really, really fast "
#~ "but you have the maximum speed set"
#~ " to a moderate amount, it will "
#~ "not get blurred)."

#~ "Especially when the camera itself moves,"
#~ " the mask created by the Vector "
#~ "Blur Node can become the entire "
#~ "image. A very simple solution is "
#~ "to introduce a small threshold for "
#~ "moving pixels, which can efficiently "
#~ "separate the hardly moving pixels from"
#~ " the moving ones, and thus, create"
#~ " nice looking masks. This minimum "
#~ "speed is in pixel units. A value"
#~ " of just 3 will already clearly "
#~ "separate the background from foreground."
