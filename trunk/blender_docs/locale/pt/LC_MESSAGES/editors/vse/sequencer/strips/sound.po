#: ../../manual/editors/vse/sequencer/strips/sound.rst:63
msgid "To animate sound strips simply hit :kbd:`I` over any of its values. Examples of animating an audio strip are to fade in/out background music or to adjust volume levels. Layered/crossed sound strips are added together; the lower channel does not override and cut out higher channels (unlike image and video strips). This makes Blender an audio mixer. By adding audio tracks and using the curves to adjust each tracks' sound level, you have an automated dynamic multi-track audio mixer!"

To render your audio in a video file make sure to use a video format as the output with an audio codec and hit the render *Animation* button in the Properties editor. Read more on how to do this :doc:`here </render/output/video>`. To render as an audio file simple use the *Audio* button. Read more on how to do this :doc:`here </render/output/video>`."
