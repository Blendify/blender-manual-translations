"A Mask Strip is used to select a mask data-block generated from "
":doc:`Movie Clip Editor </editors/movie_clip_editor/masking/index>`. This"
" works similar to the :doc:`Mask Node </compositing/types/input/mask>` "
"but without the options available for finer control. The mask image is "
"always generated at the render resolution, scaling along with different "
"proxy levels."
