"After animating some property in Blender using keyframes you can edit "
"their corresponding curves. When something is \"animated,\" it changes "
"over time. This curve in shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically "
"what an F-Curve does is it a interpolates between two animated "
"properties. In Blender, animating an object means changing one of its "
"properties, such as an objects location, or its scale."

"As mentioned, Blender's fundamental unit of time is the \"frame\", which "
"usually lasts just a fraction of a second, depending on the *frame rate* "
"of the scene. As animation is composed of incremental changes spanning "
"multiple frames, usually these properties are **not** manually modified "
"*frame by frame*, because:"

"The idea is simple: you define a few Key Frames, which are multiple "
