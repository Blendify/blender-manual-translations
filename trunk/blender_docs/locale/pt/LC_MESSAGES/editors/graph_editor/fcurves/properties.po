"This produces much smoother curves out of the box, but necessarily means "

"This mode also tends to overshoot and oscillate more with fully "
"*Automatic* handles in some cases (see the right end of the image above),"

"Considering the upsides and downsides of each mode, *Continuous "
"Acceleration* should be better suited for limited animation, which uses a"
" small number of interpolated keys with minimal manual polish. In case of"
" highly polished high key rate animation, the benefits of smoothing may "
"not outweigh the workflow disruption from more extensive change "
"propagation."
