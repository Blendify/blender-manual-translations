msgid "After animating some property in Blender using keyframes you can edit their corresponding curves. When something is \"animated,\" it changes over time. This curve is shown as something called an F-Curve. Basically what an F-Curve does is an interpolation between two animated properties. In Blender, animating an object means changing one of its properties, such as the object's location, or its scale."
