"Fluid simulations are widely used in CG, and a very desired feature of "
"any particle system, fluid particles are similar to newtonian ones but "
"this time particles are influenced by internal forces like pressure, "
"surface tension, viscosity, springs, etc. Blender particle fluids use the"
" SPH techniques to solve the particles fluid equations."

"Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a computational method used for "
"simulating fluid flows. It has been used in many fields of research, "
"including astrophysics, ballistics, vulcanology, and oceanography. It is "
"a mesh-free Lagrangian method (where the co-ordinates move with the "
"fluid), and the resolution of the method can easily be adjusted with "
"respect to variables such as the density."
