"Boid probably comes from theoretical works. *Boids* is an artificial life"
" program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the "
"flocking behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in "
"1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name refers "
"to a \"bird-like object\", but its pronunciation evokes that of \"bird\" "
"in a stereotypical New York accent. As with most artificial life "
"simulations, Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the "
"complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the"
" boids, in this case) adhering to a set of simple rules."

"The rules applied in the simplest Boids world are as follows: separation:"
" steer to avoid crowding local flockmates alignment: steer towards the "
"average heading of local flockmates cohesion: steer to move toward the "
"average position (center of mass) of local flockmates More complex rules "
"can be added, such as obstacle avoidance and goal seeking."
