"Boid probably comes from theoretical works. *Boids* is an artificial life"
" program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the "
"flocking behavior of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987"
" in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name refers to a "
"\"bird-like object\", but its pronunciation evokes that of \"bird\" in a "
"stereotypical New York accent. As with most artificial life simulations, "
"Boids is an example of emergent behavior; that is, the complexity of "
"Boids arises from the interaction of individual agents (the boids, in "
"this case) adhering to a set of simple rules."
