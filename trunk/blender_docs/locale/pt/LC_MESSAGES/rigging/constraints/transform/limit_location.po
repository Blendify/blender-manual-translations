"An object or *unconnected* bone can be moved around the scene along the "
"X, Y and Z axes. This constraint restricts the amount of allowed "
"translations along each axis, through lower and upper bounds."

"The limits for an object are calculated from its center, and the limits "
"of a bone, from its root."

"It is interesting to note that even though the constraint limits the "
"visual and rendered location of its owner, its owner's data-block still "
"allows (by default) the object or bone to have coordinates outside the "
"minimum and maximum ranges. This can be seen in its *Transform "
"Properties* panel :kbd:`N`. When an owner is grabbed and attempted to be "
"moved outside the limit boundaries, it will be constrained to those "
"boundaries visually and when rendered, but internally, its coordinates "
"will still be changed beyond the limits. If the constraint is removed, "
"its ex-owner will seem to jump to its internally specified location."

"Similarly, if its owner has an internal location that is beyond the "
"limits, dragging it back into the limit area will appear to do nothing "
"until the internal coordinates are back within the limit threshold "
"(unless you enabled the *For Transform* option, see below)."

"Setting equal the min and max values of an axis, locks the owner's "
"movement along that axis... Although this is possible, using the "
"*Transformation Properties* axis locking feature is probably easier!"

"These buttons enable the lower boundary for the location of the owner's "

"We saw that by default, even though visually constrained, the owner can "
"still have coordinates out of bounds (as shown by the *Transform "
"Properties* panel). Well, when you enable this button, this is no longer "
"possible -- the owner's transform properties are also limited by the "
"constraint. Note however, that the constraint does not directly modify "
"the coordinates: you have to grab its owner one way or another for this "
"to take effect..."
