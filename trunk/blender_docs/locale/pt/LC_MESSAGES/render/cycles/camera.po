"This projection is compatible with the environment texture as used for "

"Fisheye lenses are typically wide angle lenses with strong distortion, "
"useful for creating panoramic images for e.g. dome projection, or as an "
"artistic effect. The *Fisheye Equisolid* lens will best match real "
"cameras. It provides a lens focal length and field of view angle, and "
"will also take the sensor dimensions into account."

"The *Fisheye Equidistant* lens does not correspond to any real lens "
