"The *Bevel* shader node can be used for rendering rounded corners. Like "
"bump mapping, this does not modify the actual geometry, only the shading "
"is affected. Slight rounding on edges helps to capture specular "
"highlights that you would also see in the real world."

"Note that this is a very expensive shader, and may slow down renders by "
"20% even if there is a lot of other complexity in the scene. For that "
"reason, we suggest to mainly use this for baking or still frame renders "
"where render time is not as much of an issue. The bevel modifier is a "
"faster option when it works, but sometimes fails on complex or messy "
"geometry."
