msgid ""
"The *Subsurface Scattering* node is used to add simple subsurface "
"multiple scattering, for materials such as skin, wax, marble, milk and "
"others. For these materials, rather than light being reflect directly off"
" the surface, it will penetrate the surface and bounce around internally "
"before getting absorbed or leaving the surface at a nearby point."

"How far the color scatters on average can be configured per RGB color "
"channel. For example, for skin, red colors scatter further, which gives "
"distinctive red-colored shadows, and a soft appearance."

"Average distance that light scatters below the surface. Higher radius "
"gives a softer appearance, as light bleeds into shadows and through the "
"object. The scattering distance is specified separately for the RGB "
"channels, to render materials such as skin where red light scatters "
"deeper. The X, Y and Z values are mapped to the R, G and B values, "
"respectively."

msgid ""
"How much of the texture will be blurred along with the lighting, mixing "
"the texture at the incoming and outgoing points on the surface. Note that"
" the right choice depends on the texture. Consider for example a texture "
"created from a photograph of skin, in this case the colors will already "
"be pre-blurred and texture blur could be set to 0. Even for hand-painted "
"textures, no blurring or minimal blurring might be appropriate, as a "
"texture artist would likely paint in softening already. One would usually"
" not even know what an unblurred skin texture looks like; we always see "
"it blurred. For a procedural texture on the other hand this option would "
"likely have a higher value."

"Provides the most accurate results for thin and curved objects. This "

"like skin, but also better geometry detail preservation. Random Walk uses"
" true volumetric scattering inside the mesh, which means that it works "
