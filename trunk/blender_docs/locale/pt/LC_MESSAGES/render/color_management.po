"For correct results, different :term:`color spaces <color space>` are "
"needed for rendering, display and storage of images. Rendering and "
"compositing is best done in *scene linear* color space, which corresponds"
" more closely to nature, and makes computations more physically accurate."

"If the colors are linear, it means that if in reality, we double the "
"number of photons, the color values are also doubled. Put another way, if"
" we have two photos/renders each with one of two lights on, and add those"
" images together, the result would be the same as a render/photo with "
"both lights on. It follows that such a radiometrically linear space is "
"best for photorealistic rendering and compositing."

"However, these values do not directly correspond to human perception or "
