"Blender's animations are by default rendered as a sequence of *perfectly "
"still* images. While great for stop-motion and time-lapses, this is "
"unrealistic, since fast-moving objects do appear to be blurred in the "
"direction of motion, both in a movie frame and in a photograph from a "
"real-world camera."

"Blender can be made to render the current frame and some more 'virtual' "
"frames in between it and the next frame, then merge them all together to "
"obtain an image where moving objects are 'blurred'."

"This method is slow, but produces good results. It can be activated in "
"the *Sampled Motion Blur* panel of the render settings. This kind of "
"motion blur is done during the render."

"Set the number of samples to take for each frame. The higher the samples,"
" the smoother the blur effect, but the longer the render, as each virtual"
" intermediate frame has to be rendered."

"Time (in frames) the shutter is open. If you are rendering at 24 fps, and"
" the Shutter is set to 0.5, the time in between frames is 41.67 ms, so "
"the shutter is open for half that, 20.83 ms."

"Samples are taken only from the *next* frame, not the previous one. "
"Therefore the blurred object will appear to be slightly ahead of how it "
"would look without motion blur."

":doc:`Vector Blur </compositing/types/filter/vector_blur>` is faster but "

"avoid."

"Vector blur is a process done in compositing (post-render time), by "
"rendering the scene without any blur, plus a pass that has movement "
"information for each pixel. This information is a vector map which "
"describes a 2D or 3D direction and magnitude. The compositor uses that "
"data to blur each pixel in the given direction."

"To better grasp the concept, let's assume that we have a cube 2 units "
"wide, uniformly moving 1 unit to the right at each frame. The scale "

"Frame 1 when Sampled Motion Blur is enabled and 8 'intermediate' frames "

"Values greater than 1 are physically impossible in a real-world camera, "
"but can be used to exaggerate the effect. Better results than those shown"
" can be obtained by using higher samples than 8, but, of course, since as"
" many *separate* renders as samples are needed, a Motion Blur render "
"takes that many times more time than a non-Motion Blur one."

"Aliasing </render/blender_render/antialiasing>`, since aliasing artifacts"
" are computed differently for each sample and averaged together at the "
