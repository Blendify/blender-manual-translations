"The *Area* lamp simulates light originating from a surface (or surface-"
"like) emitter. For example, a TV screen, office neon lamps, a window, or "
"a cloudy sky are just a few types of area lamp. The area lamp produces "
"shadows with soft borders by sampling a lamp along a grid the size of "
"which is defined by the user. This is in direct contrast to point-like "
"artificial lights which produce sharp borders."

"Note that the *Distance* setting is much more sensitive and important for"
" *Area* lamps than for others; usually any objects within the range of "
"*Distance* will be blown out and overexposed. For best results, set the "
"*Distance* to just below the distance to the object that you want to "
"illuminate."

"Choosing the appropriate shape for your *Area* light will enhance the "
"believability of your scene. For example, you may have an indoor scene "
"and would like to simulate light entering through a window. You could "
"place a *Rectangular* area lamp in a window (vertical) or from neons "
"(horizontal) with proper ratio for *Size X* and *Size Y*. For the "
"simulation of the light emitted by a TV screen, a vertical *Square* area "
"lamp would be better in most cases."
