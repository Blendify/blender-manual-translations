"World settings enable you to set some basic effects which affect all "
"scenes throughout your game, so giving it a feeling of unity and "
"continuity. These include ambient light, depth effects (mist) and global "
"physics settings. These effects are a limited subset of the more "
"extensive range of effects available with the Blender internal or Cycles "
"renderer."

"While world settings offer a simple way of adding effects to a scene, "
":doc:`compositing nodes </compositing/index>` are often preferred, though"
" more complex to master, for the additional control and options they "
"offer. For example, filtering the Z value (distance from camera) or "
"normals (direction of surfaces) through compositing nodes can further "
"increase the depth and spacial clarity of a scene."

"</render/blender_render/world/ambient_occlusion>`). Its general color and"

#: ../../manual/game_engine/world.rst:51
msgid ""
"Mist can greatly enhance the illusion of depth in your rendering. To "
"create mist, Blender makes objects farther away more transparent "
"(decreasing their Alpha value) so that they mix more of the background "
"color with the object color. With Mist enabled, the further the object is"
" away from the camera the less it is alpha value will be. For full "
"details, see :doc:`Mist </render/blender_render/world/mist>`."
