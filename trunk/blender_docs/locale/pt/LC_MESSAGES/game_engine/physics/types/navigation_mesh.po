"Path-finding in Blender is based on the concept of `navigation meshes "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh>`__. With this you can "
"create navigation mesh for your level geometry directly in Blender and "
"use it in Blender Game Engine (BGE) to get your actors to find path to "
"the target and move along it. It is useful for creating an Artificial "
"Intelligence. Besides path following, there are also a few other steering"
" behaviors which can be assigned to the actor: *seek* and *flee*."

"Path-finding with navigation mesh is effective for big static obstacles. "
"To enable actors to avoid small dynamic objects during their movement "
"local obstacle avoidance can be used. If the obstacle simulation is "
"enabled the actor will try to choose direction which is free of collision"
" with obstacles on each frame during execution one of the steering "
