msgid ""
"Ensures that all deforming vertex groups add up to one while painting. "
"When this option is turned off, then all weights of a vertex can have any"
" value between 0.0 and 1.0. However, when Vertex Groups are used as "
"Deform Groups for character animation then Blender always interprets the "
"weight values relative to each other. That is, Blender always does a "
"normalization over all deform bones. Hence in practice it is not "
"necessary to maintain a strict normalization and further normalizing "
"weights should not affect animation at all."

msgid ""
"Paint on all selected Vertex Groups simultaneously, in a way that "

"weights in an area that is affected by more than three bones at once, "
"e.g. certain areas on a character's face."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/tools.rst:94
msgid ""
"This option is only useful in the Armature tab, where you can select "
"multiple Vertex Groups by selecting multiple Pose bones. Once at least "
"two Vertex Groups are selected, viewport colors and paint logic switch to"
" Multi-Paint Mode, using the sum of the selected groups' weights if Auto "
"Normalize is enabled, and the average otherwise. Any paint operations "
"aimed at this collective weight are applied to individual Vertex Group "
"weights in such way that their ratio stays the same."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/tools.rst:100
msgid ""
"Since the ratio is undefined if all weights are zero, Multi-Paint cannot "
"operate on vertices that do not have any weight assigned to the relevant "
"Vertex Groups. For this reason it also does not allow reducing the weight"
" all the way to zero. When used with X-Mirror, it only guarantees "
"completely a symmetrical result if weights are initially symmetrical."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/tools.rst:107
msgid ""
"While Multi-Paint cannot directly paint on zero-weight vertices, it is "
"possible to use the *Smooth Weight* tool to copy a reasonable non-zero "
"weight distribution from adjacent vertices without leaving Multi-Paint "
"Mode or changing bone selection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/sculpt_paint/painting/weight_paint/tools.rst:111
msgid ""
"To do that, enable vertex selection, select target vertices, and apply "
"one iteration of the tool using vertex groups from *Selected Pose Bones* "
"with low Factor. After that simply paint on top to set the desired "
"collective weight."
