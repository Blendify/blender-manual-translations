"Curve selection in *Edit* mode is much less complex than with meshes! "
"Mainly this is because you have only one selectable element type, the "
"control points (no select mode needed here...). These points are a bit "
"more complex than simple vertices, however, especially for Béziers, as "
"there is the central vertex, and its two handles..."

"The basic tools are the same as with :doc:`meshes "
"</modeling/meshes/selecting/basics>`, so you can select a simple control "
"point with a :kbd:`RMB`, add to current selection with :kbd:`Shift-RMB`, "
":kbd:`B` border-select, and so on."

"One word about the Bézier control points: when you select the main "
"central vertex, the two handles are automatically selected too, so you "
"can grab it as a whole, without creating an angle in the curve. However, "
"when you select a handle, only this vertex is selected, allowing you to "
"modify this control vector..."

":kbd:`L` (or :kbd:`Ctrl-L`) will add to the selection the cursor's "
"nearest control point, and all the linked ones, i.e. all points belonging"
" to the same curve. Note that for Bézier, using :kbd:`L` with a handle "
"selected will select the whole control point and all the linked ones."
