"Modifiers are a series of non-destructive operations which can be applied"
" on top of an objects geometry. They can be applied in just about any "
"order the users chooses."

"This kind of functionality is often referred to as a \"modifier stack\" "
"and is also found in several other 3D applications."

"In a modifier stack the order in which modifiers are applied has an "
"effect on the result. Fortunately modifiers can be rearranged easily by "
"clicking the convenient up and down arrow icons. For example, the image "
"below shows :doc:`SubSurf </modeling/modifiers/generate/subsurf>` and "
":doc:`Mirror </modeling/modifiers/generate/mirror>` modifiers that have "
"switched places."

"On the left, the *Mirror* modifier is the last item in the stack and the "
"result looks like two surfaces. On the right, the *Subsurf* modifier is "
"the last item in the stack and the result is a single merged surface."

"Modifiers are calculated from top to bottom in the stack. In this "
"example, the desired result (on right) is achieved by first mirroring the"
" object, and then calculating the subdivision surface."
