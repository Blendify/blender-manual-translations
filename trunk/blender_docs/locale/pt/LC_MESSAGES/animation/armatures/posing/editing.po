"In *Pose Mode*, bones behave like objects. So the transform actions "

"The \"transform center\" of a given bone (i.e. its default pivot point, "

"some pivot point options seem to not work properly. In fact, except for "
"the *3D Cursor* one, all others appear to always use the median point of "

"Moreover, the local space for these actions is the bone's own one "

" skin object, this might produce lag, and make interactive editing very "
"painful. If you experience such troubles, try enabling the *Delay Deform*"
" button of the *Armature* panel the skin objects will only be updated "
