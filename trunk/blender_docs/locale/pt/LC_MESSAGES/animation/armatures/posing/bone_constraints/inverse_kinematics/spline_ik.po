"Spline IK is a constraint which aligns a chain of bones along a curve. By"
" leveraging the ease and flexibility of achieving aesthetically pleasing "
"shapes offered by curves and the predictability and well integrated "
"control offered by bones, Spline IK is an invaluable tool in the riggers'"
" toolbox. It is particularly well suited for rigging flexible body parts "
"such as tails, tentacles, and spines, as well as inorganic items such as "
"ropes."

"The Spline IK Constraint is not strictly an *Inverse Kinematics* method "
"(i.e. IK Constraint), but rather a *Forward Kinematics* method (i.e. "
"normal bone posing). However, it still shares some characteristics of the"
" IK Constraint, such as operating on multiple bones, not being usable for"
" Objects, and being evaluated after all other constraints have been "
"evaluated. It should be noted that if a Standard IK chain and a Spline IK"
" chain both affect a bone at the same time the Standard IK chain takes "
"priority. Such setups are best avoided though, since the results may be "
"difficult to control."
