"Communication is a very important step in community development. Before "
"you make any edits that are not simple and plainly justified (for "
"example, moving folders around), you should verify with a manual "
"maintainer that your contribution is along the community's vision for the"
" manual. This ensures the best use of your time and good will as it is "
"otherwise possible that, for some reason, your changes will conflict and "
"be rejected or need time-consuming review. For example, another person "
"may be already working on the section you wish to change, the section may"
" be scheduled for deletion or to be updated according to a planned change"
" to Blender."

"Manual maintainers and the general community can also point to areas that"
" are in need of big or small changes. Communicating early and frequently "
"is the key to have a productive environment, to not waste people's effort"
" and to attain a better Blender manual as a result."

"If you are in doubt about functionality that you wish to document, you "

"Blender has its own system of module owners with developer and artist "
"members who are responsible for the design and maintenance of the "
"assigned Blender areas. See the `module owners page "
