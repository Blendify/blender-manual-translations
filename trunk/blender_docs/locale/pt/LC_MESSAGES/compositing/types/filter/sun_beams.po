"Sun Beams is a 2D effect for simulating the effect of bright light "
"getting scattered in a medium `(Crepuscular Rays) "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays>`__. This phenomenon can "
"be created by renderers, but full volumetric lighting is a rather arduous"
" approach and takes a lot of render time."
