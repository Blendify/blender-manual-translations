"Motion blur is the effect of objects moving so fast they blur. Because CG"
" animations work by rendering individual frames, they have no real "
"knowledge of what was where in the last frame, and where it is now."

"In Blender, there are two ways to produce motion blur. The first method "
"(which produces the most correct results) works by rendering a single "
"frame up to 16 times with slight time offsets, then accumulating these "
"images together; this is called Motion Blur and is activated on the "
"Render panel. The second (and much faster) method is the Vector Blur "
"Node."

"Maximum Speed: Because of the way vector blur works, it can produce "
"streaks, lines and other artifacts. These mostly come from pixels moving "
"too fast; to combat these problems, the filter has minimum and maximum "
"speed settings, which can be used to limit which pixels get blurred (e.g."
" if a pixel is moving really, really fast but you have the maximum speed "
"set to a moderate amount, it won't get blurred)."

#: ../../manual/compositing/types/filter/vector_blur.rst:39
msgid ""
"Minimum Speed: Especially when the camera itself moves, the mask created "
"by the Vector Blur Node can become the entire image. A very simple "
"solution is to introduce a small threshold for moving pixels, which can "
"efficiently separate the hardly moving pixels from the moving ones, and "
"thus, create nice looking masks. You can find this new option as 'min "
"speed'. This minimum speed is in pixel units. A value of just 3 will "
"already clearly separate the background from foreground."

"You can make vector blur results in a little smoother by passing the "
"Speed pass through a blur node (but note that this can make strange "
"results, so it's only really appropriate for still images with lots of "
"motion blur)."

"As far as we know, this node represents a `new approach to calculating "
"motion blur <https://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-242"
"/vector-blur/>`__. Use vector blur in compositing with confidence instead"
" of motion blur. In face, when compositing images, it is necessary to use"
" vector blur since there isn't \"real\" motion. In this `example blend-"
"file <https://download.blender.org/demo/test/driven_hand_blur.blend>`__, "
"you will find a rigged hand reaching down to pick up a ball. Based on how"
" the hand is moving (those vectors), the image is blurred in that "
"direction. The fingers closest to the camera (the least Z value) are "
"blurred more, and those farther away (the forearm) is blurred the least."
