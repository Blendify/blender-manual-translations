"The *SplitViewer* node takes two images and displays one-half of each on "
"each side (top socket on the right half, bottom socket input on the "
"left). Use this node for making side-by-side comparisons of two "
"renderings/images, perhaps from different render layers or from different"
" scenes. When transitioning between scenes, you want to be sure the stop "
"action is seamless; use this node to compare the end of one scene with "
"the beginning of another to ensure they align."
